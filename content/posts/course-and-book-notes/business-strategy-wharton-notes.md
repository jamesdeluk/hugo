## Strategy

### Definition

1. a distinctive …
    - *different from competitors*
2. …array of…
    - *more than one*
3. …interdependent choices that…
    - *complementary*
4. …address certain questions
    1. objective
    2. where to compete (product, customers, geography)
    3. value proposition
    4. source of competitive advantage (price, costs; activites, resources, capabilities)

### Evaluation

## Internal Fit

### Strategy, CA and OE vs SP

**Competitive advantage**

Fundamentally higher prices and/or lower costs

**Operational effectiveness (OE)**

- Best practice → absolute but not relative improvement (often through copying)
- Necessary but not sufficient, as often leads to strategic convergence, meaning the value proposition too similar for consumers (low differentiation)
  
**Strategic positioning (SP)**
  
- Doing different things → differentiation
- But involves tradeoffs

**Growth trap**

The larger you are, the harder it is to grow at the same rate, and forced growth (to please stakeholders) comes with tradeoffs (bad acquisitions, reduced profitability, etc)

**Many things is better than one thing**

- One thing is easier to duplicate with increased efficiencies (even if patented)
- One thing is easier to be overtaken with government assistance (so less efficient but fast to scale)
- One thing is easier to be replaced by new technologies

### Value chain - what activities make it up?

### Activity systems - how do activities interact?

![Activity system](img/bsfw2.png)

- Complementary activities (thick/main lines): more of activity A increases marginal benefit of B and vice versa
- Which are unqiue to this company? Strategic positioning
- What are the consequnces of changing an activity?
- If a competitor comes in with a completely different activity system (e.g. budget airline), often it’s impossible to adapt your activity system to compete, as it’s too different
    - GM/Toyota/NUMMI example: needed to copy entire system exactly (including country culture), not individual components/activities

## External Fit

Profitability (US): 20% industry, 20% corporation, 60% positioning

### Value Appropriation

![Value appropriation](img/bsfw3.png)

WTP varies by customers, different weighted drivers (and different weightings by customer segment)

Competitive advantage = [WTP - cost](for company A) - [WTP - cost](for company B)

### Customers and Competition

- Who is the customer, and what is their need?
- Power tool competitors: alternative tool companies AND alternative gift companies
- When BMW first came to US, they failed because they didn’t have cupholders

### Porter’s Five Forces

**Customer power:** price sensitivity; switching costs; backward integration (could customer do what we do)

**Supplier power:** same but in reverse

**New:** barriers to entry (capital, scale, brand)

**Current:** rivalry (market growth, number of competitors, strategic stakes)

**Substitutes**

### Scenario Planning

Based on uncertainties: economy, technology, terrorism, pandemic, political, …

Pick two, put in a matrix, gives four scenarios → if this, then what? → check strategy initiatives against scenarios

### Strategy

**Blue Ocean Strategy**

Sometimes parts are blue for a reason (e.g. high cost low quality) → have others tried and failed before?

**Strategy audit**

  - Indsutry: current, trends
  - Customers: WTP, cost drivers
  - Company/competitors: position, trends; business vs corporate
  - Activites: OE vs SP

## Dynamic Fit

### Honda case study

**Analysis**

- Source of competitve advantage: cost
- Product: small, lightweight bikes (easy to standardise for economies of scale)
- Customers: middle class (large, underserved)
- Geography: CA (existing market) then expand
- Engine of profitabilitiy: low price → high volume → low cost → *feedback to low price*
- Focus on long-term not short-term profits

**Reality**

- No plans/knowledge → originally wrong bike size, wrong customer segment, no low price strategy → just took action and pushed forward, overcoming obstacles as they arose
- Mostly adaptable/flexibile, but some fixed “North star” vision/values

### Barriers to response/reaction/adaption

1. Perception (is there a need?)
    - Performance vs time graph - but which performance?
    - Disruption: when new product has a far better performance in one dimention and “good enough” in one performance dimension (not better) than existing products for the majority
        - e.g. EVs: range is good enough but running costs are far better
    - WTP increases with performance, but marginal increase decreases with improvements
2. Knowledge (do we know how?)
3. Motivation (do we want to?)
    - “We make bespoke masterpieces, not mass-produced duplicates”
4. Coordination/capability (can we pull it all together?)
- + Fear / do nothing

## Setting Strategy

![Decision process](img/bsfw6.png)

### 1. Strategic Possibilities

- Generate 3-5
    - No judgement/evaluation at this stage
    - First generate individually, then convene to share and discuss
- Approaches
    - Inside out: what are we good at?
    - Outside-in: what gaps does the market have?
    - Far outside-in: what would be the Amazon of the industry?
- Is one intrigruing? Is one uncomfortable? When yes you’ve gone beyond the most obvious ones, so move onto the next stage.

### 2. Burden of Proof

- What must be true for this to be successful?
    - Don’t discuss if the truth can be realised/the condition met yet
    - Assess each possibility against these truths/conditions
- Consider the factors above
    - External: competitors, industry, regulations, … (e.g. the market must be big enough)
    - Internal: capabilities, activities, skills, … (e.g. we must be able to do it)
    - Dyanimcs: trends, technologies, economy, … (e.g. there will be no recession)
- Ask the whole team: If all these conditions were met, do you think this would be a good idea? If no, why? → premortem
- Assess the existing strategy also - not changing could also be a risk.

### 3. Analysis

- Reorder so the condition least likely to hold true is first - if it fails, you don’t need to assess the other conditions.
- Test, as surprises may happen - e.g. higher prices can outsell lower prices due to assumed value.

### 4. Decide
