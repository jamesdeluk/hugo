## Why

- Why not: Cultural differences between which animals (and parts of animals) are and aren’t food → Too cute? Too scary? Disgust? Safety? Endangered? More useful alive? Bad taste? Racism?
- Lower inputs (space, feed, water), lower emissions, higher nutrition density (low carb, medium protein, high protein, high fibre, high nutrients/minerals)
- Insects react to external (but not internal) physical pain but don’t seem to care - they don’t suffer (mental), they’re likely not conscious
- Veganism kills more than entoveganism: 1 acre of crops kills 800,000 insects
- Can be prepared in a huge variety of ways, from flour/minced to whole as nuts/land-prawns substitutes, and have a range of innate flavours
- Circular agriculture: flies eat chicken waste, chickens eat fly larvae
- Utilise food waste (avoid landfill)
- Space food!?

## Market strategy

- **Innovation success**: relative advantage (better), compatibility (with values), complexity, trialability (MVP), observability
- **Passive rejection**: lack of supply limits consumption (”I want to, but can’t”)
- **From novel to normal**: form (look like food), availability (supermarket)

## Supply

- Most common today in Thailand (leader in farming and research), Mexico (mostly traditional methods)
- Food safety concerns similar to other animal products, so ensure quality feed and cleanliness
- Novel food laws vary by region, e.g. US assumes safe and Europe assumes dangerous

### Traditional collection from the wild

- Depletion, seasonal, labour intensive, higher risk of disease

### Farming

- Largest companies in USA, Netherlands, Thailand
- Already large farms for animal feed (chickens, fish, reptiles, etc)
- Crickets
    - 21% protein chicken feed for 20 days, then 14-21% protein feed, leaves or fruits before harvest at day 45 (for flavour)
    - Maintain temperature; keep ants/predators out; avoid overcrowing; avoid inbreeding
    - Mating from days 40-45; within 24 hours of males singing, add bowl of sand/soil/rice husks for egg laying; move bowls to breeding tank, hatch in 7-10 days
- Mealworms
    - 25-30C, 65-70% humidity, leave open or ventilated lid, in dark, like crowds; harvest 3~4 months, keep 10% for next generation
    - Tiered system: tray on top for beetles, mesh for larvae to fall through to bottom tray

## Other uses

- Cheese, honey, food colouring, silk, fertiliser, tea, sweeteners, polish, medicines, …
