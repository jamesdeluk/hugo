Specifically, after 345 charge/discharge cycles at high current, this acidic reaction mechanism retained 82.8 percent of peak charge capacity.

### Chitosan-zinc

**About**

- Crustaceans such as crabs, shrimps and lobsters have exoskeletons made of cells that contain chitin, a kind of polysaccharide that makes their shells hard and resistant. This valuable material is abundant in nature and can also be found in fungi and insects, but is usually thrown away as food waste from restaurants and a byproduct of the food industry.
- Chitin can be synthesised into a firm gel membrane and used as an electrolyte for a battery. By combining this chitosan electrolyte with zinc, Hu’s team was able to create a renewable battery.
- The battery is 99.7% energy efficient even after 1,000 battery cycles, which is about 400 hours.
- The batteries are not flammable and the two-thirds of the battery made of chitosan can break down in soil thanks to microbial degradation in just five months, leaving behind recyclable zinc.

**Features**

- More energy dense

- Potentially longer life
- Theoretically lower cost

**_Developments_**

**Reducing short-circuiting**

Lithium metal batteries with solid electrolytes have been slow to develop due to mysterious short-circuiting and failure. According to the team, the issue was down to mechanical stress, which was induced while recharging the batteries. Chueh’s team is looking at ways to use these very same mechanical forces intentionally to toughen the material during manufacturing, much like a blacksmith anneals a blade during production.

**Argyrodite**

- Argyrodite as solid-state electrolyte.
- High Li-ion concentration, high stability.
- The main obstacle for argyrodite solid-state batteries is to maximize the structure, in order to meet or beat the ionic conductivity of liquid electrolytes. The new research describes the successful synthesis of a high-performing solid electrolyte in a “one-pot” process, that can be carried out at room temperature, under normal pressure, and completed in less than 15 hours.

**Isostatic Pressing**

- This process uses fluids and gases like water, oil or argon inside a machine to apply consistent pressure across a battery component, creating a highly uniform material.
- Could make battery production easier and faster while creating better conditions for energy flow.
- May also allow manufacturing the three battery layers as a single, dense system rather than creating them separately before joining them.

**3D-printed solid state**

- 3D printing instead of roll to roll
- 40% less material (so cheaper and lighter), smaller machinery, can print in any shape, 80% capacity in 15mins (C5), expects 800/1000Wh/l, longer life than traditional Li-ion

### Hydrogen

![Hydrogen efficiency](/images/old/energy-storage-2.png)

<br>

### Massless

- The batteries in today's electric cars constitute a large part of the vehicles' weight, without fulfilling any load-bearing function. A structural battery, on the other hand, is one that works as both a power source and as part of the structure -- for example, in a car body. This is termed 'massless' energy storage, because in essence the battery's weight vanishes when it becomes part of the load-bearing structure.
- It contains carbon fibre that serves simultaneously as an electrode, conductor, and load-bearing material.
- The battery has an energy density of 24 Wh/kg, meaning approximately 20 percent capacity compared to comparable lithium-ion batteries currently available. But since the weight of the vehicles can be greatly reduced, less energy will be required to drive an electric car, for example, and lower energy density also results in increased safety. And with a stiffness of 25 GPa, the structural battery can really compete with many other commonly used const
