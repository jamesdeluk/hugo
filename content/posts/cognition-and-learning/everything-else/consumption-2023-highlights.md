I re-read of all my Consumption posts from 2023 and picked out a few of my favourite bits.

I’ve generally ignored areas which are less evergreen (e.g. technological advancements), which means little on climate/energy - in part because there are *so many* exciting developments. I’ve also not included the many cool charts from Visual Capitalist.

Below are the highlights grouped by category. For 2024 I think I’ll group everything by category instead of by week, to make finding correlations easier.

I’ve also noted my favourite movies/shows/books etc from the year at the end of this post.

## Life philosophy and mindset

1. Questions stimulate thinking. Even if you know you don’t know the answer, regularly ask yourself the question anyway.
2. Don’t assume others are better than you - that they have their shit together, their opinions are all well considered, they love their life. You only see the outside.
3. Life involves making tough decisions by yourself in the absence of good information and living with the consequences. This can be trained.
4. “Hard times create strong men; strong men create good times; good times create weak men; weak men create hard times.” G. Michael Hopf
5. If a talent comes naturally to someone, they assume it’s nothing special, and instead try to improve at what seems difficult to them. Therefore, people often specialize in things they’re bad at.
6. Kleck (1980) told his research subjects they’d engage in a study to test discrimination. He painted scars on some of their faces, and then had them attend job interviews. The participants with scars painted on their faces reported feeling discriminated against for their looks. However, unknown to them, their scars had been removed before they entered the interviews. It would seem we can be victimized by the mere belief that we’re a victim.
7. Enthusiasm leads to belief leads to action leads to results.
8. Always have a “Honey, I’m home!” attitude, for everything.
9. Imagine viewing a problem/situation as if you were a different person to experience different emotions and ideas.
10. If you listen to successful people talk about their methods, remember that all the people who used the same methods and failed did not make videos about it.
11. “I do regret the passing of what I regard as one of the great luxuries of civilisation, and that is solitude. I think those snatched moments, the 20 minutes when you’re waiting at the luggage carousel, you used to have to do nothing but go into your thoughts. Now we all take out our phone, we’ve been deprived of the signal for a couple of hours on an airplane, and maybe we don’t have quite as rich an inner life. If you get in the habit of solitude - which is an entirely different thing, by the way, to loneliness - treat your mind as a garden that you can walk around in, and I think generally leads to more happiness.” Ian McKeown
12. Chung Ju-yung, the Founder of Hyundai, faced an insane amount of obstacles, from natural disasters to war to occupation to nationalisation. Believe anything is possible; be positive. There is plenty of time, but that doesn’t mean you can waste it. Take action.
13. With enough time and effort you can learn anything. Everything is sales and promotion. Life (and work) should be fun. Keep the big picture in mind. There’s plenty of time - everyone has 24 hours a day. It’s all about using the time.
14. Happiness comes after expertise is obtained.

## Skills and ability

1. People will like you for what you can do for them. Be useful. Develop skills (through practise, which often isn’t fun). It’s doesn’t matter if you’re a “nice person”. Actions speak louder than words.
2. In many situations, the outcome is more important than the mechanism. Focus on the action, not why it works.
3. Impulse control and go/no-go functions: Train no-go circuitry by stopping yourself doing unconscious behaviours/habits e.g. picking up phone without a purpose, changing a plan spontaneously, grabbing a snack. Trained through meditating (”no, I won’t explore this thought right now”). Relates to sitting and focussing on one thing for extended period without any distractions (deep work).
4. Focus/attention is the most important quality of a successful entrepreneur. Focus what you can do well, and outsource or ignore everything else.
5. The most important skill is the ability to focus your attention on a single topic. Give yourself time to simply think. And don’t multitask.
6. Pick one daily task/ritual and practise focussing 100% on it to train controlling your attention/awareness. Similar to meditation.
7. Only do the few essential things. Do less, but better. Have a single big goal. Give yourself time to be bored. Give yourself time to play, for creativity.
8. Don’t be scattered. Do the same thing every day. Repetition. If nothing else, it gets the ball rolling, removes the friction to starting.
9. The randomness of creative success favors those who are the most prolific. Price’s Law captures this relationship in scientific output, estimating that half of the research of a given discipline will be produced by the square root of the number of researchers. So in a field with 100 contributors, ten will produce half of the published output. If every paper in the field has a roughly equal probability of being cited [Dean Simonton has analyzed the creative output of individuals across many domains and suggests an “equal-odds” rule best describes it: once a creative individual starts publishing in a field, each piece of work they produce has roughly equal odds of world-breaking impact.], these ten highly prolific authors will capture approximately half of all citations in their field.
10. We prefer to attach creative success to a combination of innate talent, acquired ability and passionate commitment. (Yet) Over a surprisingly wide range of pursuits, creativity is productivity, and we will have more hits if we take more swings.

## Wealth and business

1. Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones.
2. Go to a book store, which areas interest you most? Also, what did you love when you were 12? Why?
3. Learn business skills so the techy can co-found with you.
4. Actively keep an eye out for opportunities (helping someone, attending an event) - put yourself in the best situations to get ahead. Go to the best uni/company/location to be exposed to the best people.
5. Life involves making tough decisions by yourself in the absence of good information and living with the consequences. This can be trained
6. Learning how to sell/persuade is the most important skill.
7. Put yourself out there - you never know what will happen. Create.
8. A blog post can lead to a podcast which can lead to a TV interview which can lead to huge sales. It all starts by putting something out there.
9. Create something of value to those you want to get to know and they will find you.
10. Become an expert and share advice - people will come to you and offer to pay for specific advice/consulting, or affiliate sales.
11. Where can I get paid more for the same work? Work for people/companies with more money - you are worth a percentage of the value you create for them.
12. Our empirical results confirm these predictions as millionaires (i.e., individuals who hold high status societal and occupational contexts) were more extraverted, open, conscientious, narcissistic, and emotionally stable (less neurotic) and had a more internal locus of control. More than 60% of our millionaire sample indicated that one of their main sources of wealth came from running their own company.
13. Get rich with no credentials: seller-financed boomer businesses; get rich with credentials: work for a big company.
14. After tax/inflation, average S&P return is 5.4% (not ~10%), so $10,000 invested with +$3000 a year would take 52.8 years to reach $1,000,000 (based on my maths at 10% it would take just ~35 years). Most wealthy people, in reality: own a business (including social media scammy “get rich quick” schemes), very high salary, inheritance
15. Trading time instead of output for money is a fairly modern concept, and is depressing. You can’t appear to not be working, so you have to pretend. Because of this you can’t deeply focus on something productive, such as studying something unrelated to the job you’re being paid for, or eading a book. Instead you’re limited to short, shallow consumption, such as social media, Reddit, etc. It often results in busywork or twiddling thumbs. Given we’re all going to die, wasting time in this way is an uncomfortable feeling.
16. Street Coffee: Trading Period: 1 January to 31 December 2022 (trading 50 weeks, 5 days per week); Total Revenue: GBP £144,560; Net Profit: 40%; Debt level: GBP £0
17. Mortgage rates were higher in the 70s/80s, but on a lower amount (both earnings multiple and monetary value). If salary = £25,000: 12% of £50,000 (2x) = 6% of £100,000 (4x).
18. House prices have risen faster than wages, and rents are higher than mortgages. So much is going to rent then it’s impossible to buy a house. Lack of housing is not the problem. Only option is inheritance.
19. Zombie companies: unproductive, inefficient, lacking innovation. Banks are scared of zombies defaulting on their loans, so lend them more. Governments are scared of zombies failing and increasing unemployment, so support them.

## Persuasion and negotiation

1. Pick a point in the future where you’re both happy then work your way back.
2. Empathy
    - Be able to state the position/emotion of the other person so deeply and clearly that they agree.
    - It seems like you’re having a tough time today (label emotions)
    - Try and arouse positive feelings in every small interaction: What do you love about?
3. Language choice
    - Identity: “be a helper” > “please help”
    - Choice: “should” vs “could”
    - Concrete vs abstract: concrete for satisfaction (money>refund, tomorrow>soon); abstract for dreams/inspiration/funding (a “solution”)
    - Explicitly use the word “you” for social (”it’s good for you”) but not help/support (comes across as blame/accusation)
4. Layered commands: “do A and then B” → more effective than either individually.
5. Eliciting “no” - “do you mind if I xxx or…” → their brain automatically says “no(t)”.
6. Take little control - e.g. rearrange table.
7. Repeat last words (mirror) instead of “I don’t understand” or “what do you mean?” or “tell me more”.
8. Always have more things (e.g. money, benefits, location) so you have more to offer/”sacrifice” to the other

## Relationships and society

1. Relationships (platonic and otherwise) are the most important factor for life happiness. Married people live longer.
2. 80% of women who didn’t have kids, didn’t intend to not have kids - the most common reason being that they didn’t find the right partner early enough.
3. Couples usually go to therapy when it’s too late. Normally, women try changing for years, but the man doesn’t realise, so the situation doesn’t improve, and the woman gives up. When men do finally realise there is a problem and change is needed, they do try to change, but it’s too late - the woman is beyond the threshold. This is why most women initiate divorces.
4. Most modern therapy is focussed on female solutions - feeling heard and loved - not male ones - actionable solutions to lack of purpose - hence why most men don’t like therapy, but women do.
5. “In the adult and mated male brain testosterone has dampened their neural development around verbal communication and emotional memory, but their problem-solving circuits stay large and well connected. This can lead to the perception that male brains feel emotions less than female brains, but this isn’t true. When a bonded male brain realises his partner’s upset for instance, it immediately kicks into problem-solving mode. In male-female couples this difference in instinctual responses fuels many conflicts. While a female brain partner might crave communication and connection around her issue, their male brain counterparts aren’t built for that. Their neural networks are hardwired to respond by offering solutions. it’s well intentioned sure, but baffling to a partner who doesn’t understand why they can’t just listen.”
6. Almost two-thirds of Tinder’s users are already in a relationship - and half don’t even want a date. The platforms have become sources of entertainment and social connection, while providing them with the confidence boost that comes with collecting likes and matches.
7. Crunching some dating app numbers based on the data. The median man will get 1 like and 0 matches a day; the median woman, 89 and 6. There’s no real solution except be in the top 10% of males.
8. The “mind reading” part of your brain that can tell what someone is going to do next (relating to trust and detecting cheating/lying etc), shuts down when you’re first in love.
9. “Oh, it’s not a big deal, it’s just one little thing, not worth having a big argument about it. I’ll just give in.” Well, that seems generous, but it’s a really bad idea. You have to ask yourself, “Are you really, completely, 100% over this? You’re giving in? No animosity? You’re not secretly hoping that maybe they’ll do something for you in return or a little behavior change here or there?” Because if there’s anything at all when you’re giving in that you can feel bad about later, you’re nuking the relationship - you’re creating scar tissue with yourself.
10. South Korea birth rate = 0.78. 100 parents -> 39 children -> 15 grandchildren -> 6 great-grandchildren. Terrifyingly fast drop.
11. Chances of pregnancy: female<30, 20% success in first month (so try for 6 months); older, 9 months; by 40, 5%. Chances of miscarriage: female >35, 25%; 40, 50%.
12. TLDR: Female support for body positivity is at least in-part fuelled deep down by female intrasexual competition, which pushes other women out of the dating pool by discouraging them from losing weight. A recent study published in Personality and Individual Differences found that women who are high in intrasexual competitiveness are more likely to advise women who they perceive as a potential mating threat to cut off more hair, potentially in an attempt to sabotage their attractiveness.
13. For centuries, elite academic institutions like Oxford and Harvard have been training their students to win arguments but not to discern truth, and in so doing, they’ve created a class of people highly skilled at motivated reasoning. The master-debaters that emerge from these institutions go on to become tomorrow’s elites—politicians, entertainers, and intellectuals.
14. Not only does intelligence in the service of wokeism lead to one-sided readings of reality, it also leads to the production of pure fiction. For instance, the common myth that black people are underrepresented in film (they’re overrepresented), the common myth that hate crimes are increasing (debunked), the common myth that white people are particularly prejudiced (debunked), and the common myth that rape is not about sex but power (debunked).

## Health

1. At first long cardio exercise is uncomfortable, but after a while the repetitive motion allows you to forget the motor movements (central pattern generators) and you can often feel as if you can go on forever. Stick out the first few minutes.
2. Caffeine doesn’t wake you up, it blocks the tiredness receptor. It’s painkiller for tiredness. It also raises anxiety and reduces deep sleep.
3. 100 centenarians’ 100 tips for a life well lived: Curiosity, purpose, laughing, love and family, exercise.
4. More vigorous inhales = alert; longer exhales = relaxed
5. The odour of an unrelated fertile men in the absence of regular father smell causes earlier onset of puberty in females (at least in animals).
6. Children’s brains shaped by their time on tech devices, research to-date shows. The research finds screen time leads to changes in the pre-frontal cortex of the brain, which is the base of executive functions such as working memory and the ability to plan or to respond flexibly to situations. It also finds impacts on the parietal lobe, which helps us to process touch, pressure, heat, cold, and pain; the temporal lobe, which is important for memory, hearing and language; and the occipital lobe, which helps us to interpret visual information.

## Other

1. Alistair Urquhart must have lived one of the hardest human existences of the last 100 years, if not the last 1000. Incredible.
2. The counter-intuitive discovery that air-transported green beans from Kenya could actually account for the emission of less carbon dioxide than British beans. - How the myth of food miles hurts the planet
3. Complicated systems function predictably according to specific parameters, even if they are incredibly numerous. Complex systems are never fully understood and are therefore impossible to predict with certainty. - [The Attributes] It’s not Complicated, it’s Complex
4. Adulteration of honey with cheap sugar syrup has been exposed in a new investigation by the European Commission, which found 46% of sampled products were suspected to be fraudulent. Ten honey samples from the UK all failed the tests. They may have been blended or packaged in Britain, but the honey probably originated overseas.

> After reviewing the documents, I have identified the top three most important key learnings that would help someone live a better life:
> 
> 
> **Cultivating Discipline and Positive Habits**: Building positive habits and cultivating discipline are crucial for personal growth and success. It is important to overcome each one-second decision and focus on taking small steps towards our goals. By adopting an organized mindset, such as through meditation and reducing input, we can develop the discipline needed to achieve our aspirations.

> 

> Based on the key learnings from the KB, the best way to build meaningful relationships involves the following strategies:
> 
> 
> **Be Proactive**: Meaningful friendships don't always happen organically in adulthood. It requires proactive effort on our part. Take the initiative to reach out, engage, and connect with others. Attend social events, join communities, and participate in activities that align with your interests. By being proactive, we increase the chances of forming connections with like-minded individuals.
> 
> **Foster Shared Experiences**: Building relationships is facilitated through repeated unplanned interactions and shared vulnerability. Engage in activities that give you the opportunity to bond with others. Invite new people to join you in these activities, creating opportunities for shared experiences and connections to develop. This could be anything from joining a hobby group to participating in community events. The key is to create an environment where people can connect on a deeper level.
> 
> **Practice Authenticity and Empathy**: Authenticity is crucial in building meaningful relationships. Be genuine in your interactions and show a sincere interest in others. Listen actively and empathize with their experiences and perspectives. By demonstrating empathy, you create a safe and supportive environment that fosters trust and deepens connections.
> 
> **Prioritize Quality Over Quantity**: It's important to remember that it's not about the number of connections but the quality of those relationships. Focus on building a few close friendships rather than trying to accumulate a large network. Invest your time and energy in nurturing these relationships, as they are more likely to provide fulfillment and support in the long run.
> 
> **Be a Valuable Resource**: Become an expert in a particular field or area of interest. Share your knowledge and insights with others, offering valuable advice and guidance. By positioning yourself as a resource, people will naturally be drawn to you and seek your expertise. This can lead to meaningful connections and potential collaborations.

Seek out independently-minded thinkers and those who share similar values and goals. Building relationships within a positive and supportive environment can provide encouragement, motivation, and a sense of belonging.
> 

> Building wealth requires a combination of strategies and approaches. Here are some strategies for wealth-building based on the information from the KB:

Additionally, explore opportunities on platforms like Upwork or Fiverr to offer your skills and expertise to a wider audience.
> 
> **Take Calculated Risks**: Don't be afraid to take risks when it comes to financial opportunities. In an efficient market, risk is proportionate to reward. Therefore, consider taking calculated risks that have a high expected value. However, it is important to ensure that you can afford the risks you take.
> 
> **Build Valuable Relationships**: Human relationships play a crucial role in wealth-building. Focus on networking, building connections, and providing value to others. By creating meaningful relationships, you increase the chances of finding new opportunities and collaborations that can contribute to your wealth-building journey.
