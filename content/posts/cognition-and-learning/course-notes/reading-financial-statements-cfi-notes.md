## Balance Sheet

aka Statement of Financial Position

Current = <1 year

**Assets and liabilities**

- Deferred taxes: timing difference between accounting income and taxable income → can be asset and/or liability
- Goodwill: e.g. brand, customers, premium paid on acquisition
- Intangible: e.g. trademark, patent, copyright
- Contingencies: e.g. lawsuit with expected future payout

e.g. 12 month subscription for £100 → both cash and unearned revenue +£100, each month unearned -£10, revenue +£10

**Shares**

- Common (voting rights, profits) and preferred (fixed dividend)
- Authorised (capable of selling) and outstanding (sold)
- Contributed surplus: value sold for above share face value

**Notes**

- Significant accounting policies: hows
- Direct information: breakdown of investments and instruments
- Indirect information: unrelated to numbers

## Income Statement

aka P&L, Statement of Operations

Single- vs muiltiple-step (single net income line vs lines for operating income, pre-tax income, etc)

COGS, SGA (advertising, legal/admin fees, office supplies, rent, etc), other income or expenses (sales of investments, forex, etc)

## Cash Flow Statement

Operating (day-to-day), investing (non-current assets / M&As), financing (shares or debt) activities

Direct (separated into cash recevied and cash paid) vs indirect (start with net income and add non-cash (working capital) adjustments e.g. accounts receivable, accounts payable, inventory)
