# Business Analysis Foundations

[https://www.linkedin.com/learning/business-analysis-foundations-4](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/business-analysis-foundations-4)

## Introduction

“The practise of enabling change in the context of an enterprise by defining the needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to stakeholders” - IIBA

"The process by which we identify business needs, recommend relevant solutions, and understand requirements."xxxxxxx

**Activities**: understand current needs; focus on strategic objectives; help achieve goals

_Can act at a business or project level_

**Skills**: business acumen, analytical, communication

## Needs assessment

### Categories of needs

1. Problems or possible improvements
2. Opportunities or new endeavours
3. Compliance requirements

### Process

1. Identify the problem
2. Assess the current state
3. Discern the future state
4. Determine the gaps

### Situation statement

1. The _problem or opportunity_
2. has the effect of _X_
3. with the resulting impact of _Y_.

### Tools

- Ishikawa diagram
- Five Whys

### Solution statement

Sentence recommending the most viable option to meet the needs while also defining initial scope and steps.

**But always provide multiple options.**

### Feasibility study

## Stakeholders

“An individual, group, or organisation that may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project.” - PMBOK

Classifying: Power vs Interest matrix

Stakeholder engagement: format, content, timing

## Business case

Documents benefits and justifies costs

Components: Situation statement, stakeholders, scope, relationship with organisational strategies, (root cause) analysis, success factors, potential gaps, risk assessment, assumptions, milestones, roles and responsibilities, financials (payback period, NPV, IRR, ROI, …), alternatives, …

## Planning

Vision (short, precise, aligned across teams → an elevator pitch): Why, what, who, when, where, how

Involves: Sponsor, PM, BA, stakeholders

Roadmap with milestones

BA gives PM: activities needed to elicit, analyse, and evaluate requirements, and activities tracing, veriyfing, and validating requirements

Sometimes BA and PM roles are combined

## Determining requirements

### Types

- Business: high level needs of the organisation
- Stakeholder: internal or external
- Solution: features, functions, characteristics
    - Functional: e.g. webstore
    - Non-functional: e.g. security
- Transition: activities to move from current to future state e.g. training
- Project: PM responsibility
- Quality: QA responsibility

### Elicitation

Facilitated sessions, interviews (structured, semi, unstructured), …

### Modelling

- Process modelling: verbs → determine the process
- Data modelling: nouns → determine the product/customer

## Traceability and monitoring requirements

Traceability approach (how requirements are related) and traceability matrix (tool for tracking e.g. Kanban board)

Change control and configuration control (using version control)

## Evaluating the solution

Verification (conforms with specification) + validation (confirm results meets acceptance criteria and stakeholder needs)

Use RACI to ensure everyone is communicated with correctly

## Preparing for release and transition

Release plan: Who is it being released to? Can it (or must it) be deployed in (prioritised) stages?

Transition plan: Pilots, old and new simultaneous and phase out, or Big Bang. Is training needed?

Monitor implementation to ensure requirements were met and see future potential improvements

# Strategic Business Analysis Essentials

## Business Solutions through Strategic Analysis

- Map out the roadmap from current to future state
- Consider ways to minimise business risk
- Anticipate how to increase adoption while achieving the desired outcome

Define the aim. Is it a problem or an opportunity?

### Skills

1. Be a listener
2. Be a simplifier
3. Be transparent

## Strategic Business Analysis Process and Outcomes

### Analyse current state

Why it needs to change and what will be affected (directly or indirectly)

Need to understand:

- Organisational needs
- Organisational structure and cultures
- Capabilities and processes
- Technology and infrastructure
- Policies
- Business architecture
- Internal assets
- External influencers

### Define future state

Can be done in parallel with analysing current state

Determine the set of necessary conditions to meet the business need

### Assess risks

Identify, timing, circumstances, solutions, recommendation, etc

Severity vs Likelihood matrix

Check for unknowns, constraints/assumptions/dependences, negative impacts to value, risk tolerance

### Define change strategy

1. Solution scope
2. Gap analysis
3. Enterprise readiness assessment
4. Change strategy recommendation

### Plan for the transition state

- Organisational ability to absorb change
- Change heat map
- Timing for change
- Timeline to deliver benefits
- Alignment of change

## Strategic BA Tools and Techniques

### PESTLE

Political Economical Social Technological Legal Environmental

### Porter’s Five Forces

Competition in the industry; potential of new entrants into the industry; Power of suppliers; power of customers; threat of substitute products

### MOST and Resources Audit

Mission Objectives Strategy Tactics

Current tangible and intangible resources

### BCG Matrix

Growth-Share: Cash cow, star, question mark, dog

### Ansoff’s Matrix

Markets vs Products/Services

Existing vs New

Market Penetration, Market Development, Diversification, Product Development

### SWOT

Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Threats

# Business Analysis Foundations: Business Process Modelling

[https://www.linkedin.com/learning/business-analysis-foundations-business-process-modeling](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/business-analysis-foundations-business-process-modeling)

**Process**

1. Capture processes
2. Provide visual representation
3. Identify what’s needed

In modelling, stakeholders = actors (person, system, or functional area)

Modelling languages: UML and BPMN

Tool: Visio

### 1. Context Diagram

Circle is what you have control over (i.e. organisation), box represents what you have influence over

Don’t get too complex e.g. group different suppliers into single supplier entity if the same processes/relationships

![Untitled.png](/images/old/eaciball.png)

### 2. Functional Flow Diagram

Start with external entity e.g. customer

Focus on a single interaction

Focus on the what is transacted not how

![Untitled.png](/images/old/eaciball-1.png)

### 3. Cross-Functional Flow Diagram

Circle = start/stop (terminator), rectangle = process, parallel lines = sub-process, plus symbol = expansion, diamond = decision, arrows

Verb-noun combination

Rule of thumb: no more than 16 boxes

![Untitled](/images/old/eaciball-2.png)

### 4. Flowchart Diagram

aka Process Maps

KRAC: Keep Remove Add Change

Enables impact assessments

Focus on a single functional area

# Business Analysis Foundations: Competencies

[https://www.linkedin.com/learning/business-analysis-foundations-competencies](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/business-analysis-foundations-competencies)

## Relationship building and management

**Co-creating**: shared understanding of big picture and requirements details

**Rapport and empathy**: “what does success look like?” “so what I’m hearing is…”

**Conflict management**: separate people from the problem; focus on the desired outcome and organisational goals

## Leadership

**Influence without authority**: understand their resistances and receptiveness, align to their motivations

**Decision-making**: know who the decision-makers are, what the decisions are, and what data is needed to make the decisions

**Change management**: identifying impact groups and how to support them

## Facilitation

**Meetings**: agendas with purpose, objective, topcs (from their perspective); make sure everyone is heard

**Conversations**: open, thought-provoking questions; break into pairs/small groups then collate

**Requirements processes**: requirements evolve and emerge over time

## Communication

**Verbal**: phrasing and tone of questions, summarisations, general information

**Listening**: hearing for intent not only the words; for logic and biases

**Visual**: tables, matrices, diagrams, models

**Written**: story from the user’s point of view; clear asks/next steps

## Business

**Business**: how the product/project strategically aligns to the organisation and which teams it affects; what the KPIs are; who the organisation’s customers are

**Innovation**: discover → develop → deliver

**Architecture and processes**: enables seeing existing links/systems across/in the organisation and relating to the product/project

## Analytical

**Systems thinking**: break down big concepts to smaller pieces, how one thing impacts another

**Creativity**: also fostering creativity in others

**Visual modelling and diagrams**: for communication, analysis, catch unstated requirements

**Data analysis**: understand, identify, find meaning, flows, relationships, connections, gain insights

**Curiosity**: ask questions (with the right tone), challenge assumptions

## Technical

**Productivity tools**

**Technology landscape**: future trends e.g. AI

**Data, process, and rules**: e.g. shipping address, web form, data format validation
