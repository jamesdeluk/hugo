## Stats

In 2020, the government estimated around 6 million businesses in the UK, of which 5.94 million were small (0–49 employees) and 36,100 were medium-sized enterprises (50–249 employees). Only 7,800 businesses were deemed large (BEIS, 2020).

Micro-businesses are considered to be those with fewer than ten employees and a turnover of less than £2m. An SME may have up to 250 employees and a turnover of up to £25m, which in the UK represents over 99 per cent of all businesses (Rhodes, 2017).

The UK government prioritises financial services, science and technology, energy and health sectors. You may find that funding is more readily available in the priority sectors.

## Dilemmas

1. building confidence

## Customers vs consumers

- Customers are those that purchase a good or service.
- Consumers are those who use a product or service.

## Market research

- Are the benefits of the product clearly communicated and believable?
- Does the product or service address a need or solve a problem?
- What other products or services can you imagine using to meet the need?
- What is the customer’s perception of how valuable the product or service would be to them?
- Would they use/purchase the product or service?
- How often would they use/purchase it and where would they look for it?

## Customer segments
