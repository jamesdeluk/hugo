## Introduction

Corporation = multiple businesses

Businesses differentiated by who, what, how (customer, product, place)

Corporate strategy = portfolio selection + portfolio organisation

### Ownership

Ownership matrix: Parent vs business, public vs private

Shares ≠ votes. Example: Family owns 80% of parent, which owns 40% of business (but 60% of voting rights). Family have 32% of shares and 48% of votes. But as family has 80% of parent (majority), they can control all 60% of voting rights.

### Influence

Influence matrix: Directive vs evaluative (whether HQ makes decisions or set goals), standalone vs linkage (how closely businesses work together)

### Advantage

**Business advantage**

Willingness to pay/supply (= max selling price, min production costs)

WTP advantage: higher WTP, same WTS (same product, higher price)

WTS advantage: lower WTS, same WTP (same product, lower costs)

**Corporate advantage**

Businesses more valuable owned jointly than separately

Note: don’t need business advantage in each business

### Competitors

Of a business: after the same customers

Of a corporate: mutual funds, private equity, conglomorates

Matrix: Joint ownership (selection) vs joint decision making (modification)

Benefits from selection are more likely to be gained in inefficient markets

### Sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) analysis

Enterprise value (EV) / earnings (E)

(EV - debt) / # shares = expected share price

EV_SOTP = E_actual * (EV/E)_(single business peers) → see if grouped business is over- or under-valued compared to others

Earnings are a fixed input - cannot make predictions whether separation will affect earnings

SOTP cannot be used for determining corporate advantage

### Synergies

Shared resources (land, labour, capital) in the value chain (e.g. R&D, procurement, manufacturing, distribution/logistics, branding, sales)

High modification, high similarity: **consolidation** → Remove redundancy e.g. shared HR function

High modification, low similarity: **customisation** → e.g. sharing R&D to transfer technologies

Low modification, high similarity: **combination** → Achieve economies of scale e.g. shared procurement / reduced number of suppliers

Low modification, low similarity: **connection** → e.g. shared distribution

### Bargains

Low entry costs (e.g. underpriced company)

## Diversification

Value together > value individually + costs of change

### 1. Find synergies

“How”, not “what” or “why” → assess each stage of the value chain

### 2. Identify resource gaps

What current resource gaps exist, and how could diversification fill them?

How many new resources are needed for diversification, or how many can come from existing businesses?

### 3. Identify candidates (for inorganic growth)

1. Insider generalist (experience in industry to enter) → if resource gaps are large
2. Insider specialist
3. Outsider (no experience in industry to enter)

### 4. Evaluating ally or acquire

- Alliance
    - Non-equity (low ownership → lower cost, lower risk, less chance of partner demotivation)
    - Equity (high ownership → better coordination, cooperation, exclusivity)
    - Joint venture
- M&A

*If no good options, move to organic*

### 5. Evaluating organic (vs inorganic growth) options

- Easy to copy (competitors) → barriers to entry e.g. patents
- Easy to catch up (with competitors) → network effects, reputation; current capabilities
- Easy to substitute → online sales instead of overcoming competitor shops

## Divestitute

Value together < value individually + costs of change

### 1. Find synergies

“How”, not “what” or “why” → assess each stage of the value chain

### 2. Identify better parents

*Other company has better synergies, so business is more valuable to other company*

1. Companies in the same sector
2. Companies in a different sector
3. Investment companies

### 3. Choosing divestiture mode

1. Sell-off: full sale
2. Spin-off: split and distribute shares to original owners
3. Equity carve-out: partial/slow sale
4. Split-up: separation

## Resource allocation

### Financial

Fund those with highest NPV of projects (assuming NPV is positive)

### Risk / uncertainty

BCG matrix: Market growth vs market share (question marks, stars, cash cows, dogs) → fund question marks with stars and cash cows

### Synergy

Synergistic portfolio framework

![Synergistic portfolio framework](/images/old/spf.png)

Incoming benefit = (EV of business before spin-off) - (EV of business after spin-off)

Outgoing benefit = (EV of portfolio before spin-off) - (EV of portfolio after spin-off)

Invest above the line (Fits, Givers, Takers)

Exploration - may invest in Altruist, Paraside, or Misfit, if risk appetite is high

### Social

Positive NPV becomes negative if “unfair” (e.g. no funding)
