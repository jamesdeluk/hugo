I built an interactive map for UK house prices. You can see things such as:

- What was the median property price in W1 in 2015?
- Where is the median price for a flat under £300,000?
- Where can I afford a detached house on 15x salary?
- How have office prices changed over time?

It's a bit slow as it's hosted on a minimal GCP Cloud Run instance to save costs, and there is a lot of data. If it crashes, just refresh.
