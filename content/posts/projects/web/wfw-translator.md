With the help of Google Translater, Deepl, and LLMs such as ChatGPT, translating text from one language to another has never been easier.

However, this doesn't necessarily help you learn it.

For example, I'm intermediate-level Korean. I can read most Korean, but there is the odd word I don't know. Putting the sentence into a translator often doesn't help as, due to sentence structure, idioms, meaning etc, it can be difficult to tie the output back to the input. The best solution is to put the unknown word into a dictionary or translator, but that's time-consuming.

So, I made a little tool that translates a passage, both as a whole, and word-by-word. It's not perfect, as it doesn't understand the context or the grammar - but, for an intermediate, this is fine, as you can easily understand what it's meant to be.
