## Energy, Climate, and the Future

### Temperature-sensing building material changes color to save energy

[https://pme.uchicago.edu/news/temperature-sensing-building-material-changes-color-save-energy](https://pme.uchicago.edu/news/temperature-sensing-building-material-changes-color-save-energy)

- On hot days, the material can emit up to 92 percent of the infrared heat it contains, helping cool the inside of a building. On colder days, however, the material emits just 7 percent of its infrared, helping keep a building warm.
- Hsu and colleagues designed a non-flammable “electrochromic” building material that contains a layer that can take on two conformations: solid copper that retains most infrared heat, or a watery solution that emits infrared. At any chosen trigger temperature, the device can use a tiny amount of electricity to induce the chemical shift between the states by either depositing copper into a thin film, or stripping that copper off.

### Novel adaptation for existing blast furnaces could reduce steelmaking emissions by 90%

[https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2023/novel-adaptation-for-existing-blast-furnaces-could-reduce-steelmaking-emissions-by-90](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2023/novel-adaptation-for-existing-blast-furnaces-could-reduce-steelmaking-emissions-by-90)

- This radical reduction is achieved through a ‘closed loop’ carbon recycling system, which could replace 90% of the coke typically used in current blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace systems.
- Under a high concentration of CO2, the perovskite splits CO2 into oxygen, which is absorbed into the lattice, and CO, which is fed back into the blast furnace.

### 10 Mental Models for Learning

[https://youtu.be/r7gK6f1ZBRI](https://youtu.be/r7gK6f1ZBRI)

1. Problem-Solving is Search
2. Memory Strengthens by Retrieval *[JG: Not revision]*
3. Knowledge Grows Exponentially
4. Creativity is Mostly Copying *[JG: Idea sex]*
5. Skills Are Specific
6. Mental Bandwidth is Extremely Limited *[JG: Don’t multitask; break things down]*
7. Success is the Best Teacher *[JG: Aim for 85% success]*
8. We Reason Through Examples
9. Knowledge Becomes Invisible with Experience *[JG: Unconscious competence → but need to be conscious to teach others or reassess based on new data]*
10. Relearning is Relatively Fast

### 5 Habits of Highly Disciplined People - James Clear

[https://youtu.be/7dz9Mcsvi8c](https://youtu.be/7dz9Mcsvi8c)

1. Change your environment (unplug the TV)
2. Start small (meditate for only 2mins)
3. Focus on the trigger action (the habit is putting on your gym clothes, not going to the gym)
4. Join a community (social pressure to not break the habit)
5. Variable rewards (jar of marbles with 10% rewards)

### What the Longest Study on Human Happiness Found is the Key to a Good Life

[https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/harvard-happiness-study-relationships/672753/](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/harvard-happiness-study-relationships/672753/)

- The average American in 2018 spent 11 hours every day on solitary activities such as watching television and listening to the radio. Spending 58 days over 29 years with a friend is infinitesimal compared with the 4,851 days that Americans will spend interacting with media during that same time period.
- Repeatedly, when the participants in our study reached old age, they would make a point to say that what they treasured most were their relationships.

### The Secret to Making New Friends as an Adult | Marisa G. Franco | TED

[https://youtu.be/-k0p-DYYZKU](https://youtu.be/-k0p-DYYZKU)

- Friendship doesn’t happen organically in adulthood - you have to be proactive.
- We’re less likely to be rejected than we think (see [this](https://www.jamesgibbins.com/posts/consumption-week4/#9-mental-distortions-that-are-sabotaging-your-social-life) from last week) - so assume people like you (which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy).
- Intimate, relational (friends), and group/community friendships - you need all three.
- Built through repeated unplanned interactions and shared vulnerability.
    - The Like Switch by Jack Schafer: Proximity, frequency, duration, intensity.
- Have activities to be doing, and invite new people to them.
- Have a group you can regularly attend to join the community.

- Start with what you don't want, and find how to avoid it.
- Be interested, and like the people you work with.
- Low interest rates inversely correlate with asset prices (interest rates are like gravity to stock).
- Learning is not memorising information, it's changing behaviour.
- All great companies obsess over customers.

    - They used the platform for a non-intended use, building on their existing community.
- Beware of stretch goals reducing your ability to produce the final product - you're not a t-shirt company.
- Don't overthink, just try it.
- Social proof (a crowd) is most important for sales/success.

### This one-page calendar will change how you view the year

[https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/one-page-calendar/](https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/one-page-calendar/)

![Calendar](/img/week5-calendar.png)

- Another year? Except for the placement of the months (in blue) in the upper-right corner of the one-page calendar, everything else is always the same, year-after-year. Moreover, the way the months are placed shifts in an extremely predictable, repeating pattern. There are only 14 possible calendar configurations: one for each of the seven non-leap years where January 1st begins on each of the seven days of the week, and one for each of the seven leap years where January 1st begins on each possible day of the week. The same calendar that works in 2023 will also work again in 2034, 2045, 2051, 2062, 2073, 2079, 2090, 2102, 2113, and 2119.
