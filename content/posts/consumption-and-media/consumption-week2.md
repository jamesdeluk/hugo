[https://open.spotify.com/episode/0NYR5b0RktTaxWi68kT1io](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0NYR5b0RktTaxWi68kT1io)

[https://tim.blog/2023/01/06/james-clear-atomic-habits/](https://tim.blog/2023/01/06/james-clear-atomic-habits/)

- The bad days matter more than the good days. Even if you only do 10% of what you hoped, that's still more than 0.
- Content creation and marketing:
    - A blog post can lead to a podcast which can lead to a TV interview which can lead to huge sales. It all starts by putting something out there.
    - Be aware of letting other platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) own your content and audience and leads. You could easily lose control.
    - Create to help - be thoughtful and genuine.
    - Personalise marketing materials e.g. “you might like this part”
- Habits:
    - Build an identity by doing the actions that identity would do e.g. “I am the type of person who goes to the gym every day”
    - How you spend your time demonstrates your priorities.
    - Building a habit: Make it obvious, attractive, easy, satisfying. Find how by asking questions: “How can this be easy?" e.g. Meditation: a ॐ poster, a comfy chair, start with 60 seconds, eat chocolate after
    - Have pre-activity rituals to preprogramme action. e.g. Music when getting ready for the gym.

- He took advantage of loopholes and questionable activities, and kept a low profile.
    - But how did it find them? That would be the really useful thing to know.

[https://youtu.be/NLHdCkcqnWE](https://youtu.be/NLHdCkcqnWE)
