## Children’s brains shaped by their time on tech devices, research to-date shows

[https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1008150](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1008150)

- The research finds screen time leads to changes in the pre-frontal cortex of the brain, which is the base of executive functions such as working memory and the ability to plan or to respond flexibly to situations. It also finds impacts on the parietal lobe, which helps us to process touch, pressure, heat, cold, and pain; the temporal lobe, which is important for memory, hearing and language; and the occipital lobe, which helps us to interpret visual information.
- This was deemed as both potentially positive and negative, but mainly more negative.
