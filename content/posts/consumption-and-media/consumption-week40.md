## How Did Gogoro Go From Stealth Startup To Global Battery-Swapping Leader in Just Over A Decade?

[https://cleantechnica.com/2023/09/29/how-did-gogoro-go-from-stealth-startup-to-global-battery-swapping-leader-in-just-over-a-decade/](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/09/29/how-did-gogoro-go-from-stealth-startup-to-global-battery-swapping-leader-in-just-over-a-decade/)

- One factor that no doubt played a role in shaping Gogoro’s approach to strategy is the fact that the company’s CEO, Horace Luke, spent a formative decade of his career as a creative director at Microsoft. Helping to launch new products including Xbox and Windows XP, he learned how to build an ecosystem of manufacturers, distributors, and retailers centered around a shared platform, rather than a proprietary product.
- First, Gogoro developed a standard specification for swappable batteries that could be used in its own vehicles and in those produced by other manufacturers.
- Second, Gogoro implemented new business models aligned to the systems transformation it aimed to deliver. One of these was a customer-facing battery-as-a-service business model for vehicle owners that provides convenient access to Gogoro’s network of battery-swapping stations. A second was the GoShare model, offering instant access to shareable electric two-wheelers.
- The third component of Gogoro’s approach is its physical battery-swapping platform, which uses big data, AI, and machine learning to connect an entire ecosystem of smart vehicles, energy, and services for its users.

## Tire Dust Makes Up the Majority of Ocean Microplastics, Study Finds

[https://www.thedrive.com/news/tire-dust-makes-up-the-majority-of-ocean-microplastics-study-finds](https://www.thedrive.com/news/tire-dust-makes-up-the-majority-of-ocean-microplastics-study-finds)

- A report from the Pew Charitable Trust found that 78 percent of ocean microplastics are from synthetic tire rubber.
- Emissions Analytics found that a single car's four tires collectively release 1 trillion "ultrafine" particles for every single kilometer (0.6 miles) driven. These particles, under 100 nanometers in size, are so tiny that they can pass directly through the lungs and into the blood. They can even cross the body's blood-brain barrier.
