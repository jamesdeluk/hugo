## Solarge Debuts Lightweight Fully Recyclable Solar Panels

[https://cleantechnica.com/2023/04/19/solarge-debuts-lightweight-fully-recyclable-solar-panels/](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/04/19/solarge-debuts-lightweight-fully-recyclable-solar-panels/)

- Weigh 50% less, have 80% fewer carbon emissions during the manufacturing process, contain no PFAS materials, and are 100% recyclable.
- There is no information available from the company about cost or efficiency.

## A new microwave technology can ease solar cell recycling

[https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/a-new-microwave-technology-can-ease-solar-cell-recycling](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/a-new-microwave-technology-can-ease-solar-cell-recycling)

- The silicon found in solar panels goes through annealing in a furnace with a temperature ranging between 900 and 1100 °C.
- The researchers explain that microwave radiation selectively heats silicon and leaves the laminated panel of glass, aluminum, and plastic largely unaffected.
- Under treatment, the plastic coating, which protects the silicon plate from contamination and moisture, gets softened and hence can be peeled off mechanically. The scale can be then easily delaminated, and its components can be reused without harsh chemicals.

## Pedro Pascal as IPCC assessment reports and iconic figures: a thread

## Scientists Isolate Microbes That Eat Carbon Dioxide

- The new microbe, called a cyanobacteria, turns carbon dioxide into biomass faster than any other known bacteria.

## This eco-friendly concrete uses biochar to suck out carbon dioxide

[https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/eco-friendly-concrete-biochar-carbon-dioxide](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/eco-friendly-concrete-biochar-carbon-dioxide)

- The biochar was able to suck up to 23 percent of its weight in carbon dioxide from the air while still achieving a strength comparable to ordinary cement.

## ‘Smart Plastic’ Material is Step Forward Toward Soft, Flexible Robotics and Electronics

- A harder and more rigid material was formed in the areas the light touched, while the unlit areas retained their soft, stretchy properties.

## Our understanding of reverse osmosis has just been proven wrong

[https://interestingengineering.com/science/reverse-osmosis-desalination-clean-water-ro-diffusion](https://interestingengineering.com/science/reverse-osmosis-desalination-clean-water-ro-diffusion)

- The computer simulations revealed that a pressure gradient was driving the water transport within the membranes, not a water concentration gradient.

## Insects As Food – Europe Approves Three Types

[https://happyeconews.com/insects-as-food-europe-approves-three-types/](https://happyeconews.com/insects-as-food-europe-approves-three-types/)

- After yellow mealworms were authorized by the European Food Safety Authority in June, two more types of insects have been given the green light for human consumption: the house cricket and the migratory locust.

## [People Fixing the World] The hidden powers of bacteria

- Recycle metal
- Recycle plastic
- High-protein food additive
- Fertiliser (nitrogen) replacement

## Novel wound dressing changes colour when it detects an infection

[https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/novel-wound-dressing-changes-colour-when-it-detects-an-infection](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/novel-wound-dressing-changes-colour-when-it-detects-an-infection)

- If the wound becomes infected, the color of the dressing will change. This color change property is determined by the wound's pH. Normal wounds (non-infected) have a pH of about 5.5, but when an infection develops, the pH rises to 8, or even higher.

## Where We Are in the Big Cycle: On the Brink of a Period of Great Disorder

[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/where-we-big-cycle-brink-period-great-disorder-ray-dalio/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/where-we-big-cycle-brink-period-great-disorder-ray-dalio/)

- Each force, and most importantly, the combination of them, is now occurring at the largest magnitude since the 1930-45 period and at levels of magnitude similar to those that existed just before prior breakdowns and seismic shifts in domestic and world orders.
1. Enormous amounts of debt
2. Big conflicts within countries (now most importantly the US)
3. Big conflicts between countries arising from the rise of countries (now most importantly China)
4. Acts of nature—i.e., climate change.
5. Technology changes—e.g. AI.
- Because populists are so committed to winning at all costs and are unwilling to compromise, more-intense-than-expected battles are more likely. Each one of these forces is a part of the system. For example, the debt ceiling increase will not go as smoothly as most people expect and will likely become a big election issue that will split the country because both sides will fight for victories and will be less willing to compromise. Also, in this election year, aggressiveness with China will intensify because most everyone is anti-China, so those running will want to outdo each other with their China-bashing. Continuing engagement between US and Taiwanese leaders will likely still happen, which, together with the Gallagher House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party hearings, will push the US-China conflict closer to the brink (or over the brink).

- JG: Having been chased by a Kangaroo, I can confirm they’re bloody terrifying. Apparently they even drown other creatures.

## What's our Problem - Tim Urban

- Scientist, sports fan, lawyer, zealot
    - What’s the goal, to get to the truth, or to win no matter what?
- Idea lab (idea≠person, can disagree and change) vs echo chamber (idea=person identity, cannot disagree, cannot change)
- Mass collaboration: genies (humans working together for good, sum is greater than the parts) vs golems (humans working together for bad, us vs them)
