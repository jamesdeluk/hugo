## 3D-Printed “Living Material” Could Clean Up Contaminated Water

[https://cleantechnica.com/2023/09/06/3d-printed-living-material-could-clean-up-contaminated-water/](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/09/06/3d-printed-living-material-could-clean-up-contaminated-water/)

- Dubbed an “engineered living material,” it is a 3D-printed structure made of a seaweed-based polymer combined with bacteria that have been genetically engineered to produce an enzyme that transforms various organic pollutants into benign molecules. The bacteria were also engineered to self-destruct in the presence of a molecule called theophylline, which is often found in tea and chocolate. This offers a way to eliminate them after they have done their job.

## ‘Swikini’ and self-cleaning path among UK inventions in 2022

[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/03/swikini-and-self-cleaning-path-among-uk-inventions-in-2022](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/03/swikini-and-self-cleaning-path-among-uk-inventions-in-2022)

- These included a cricket training aid in the shape of a batsman, a pair of tongs for perfectly piercing shisha foil, a bed covering with less insulation over the genital area to encourage male fertility, an oven with an automatic tray, a urine collection system for fighter pilots, and a wearable device that helps monitor and manage Parkinson’s tremors.
- The figures also give an insight into the UK’s most innovative companies. Dyson led the list, with 234 patents registered, including several for its Dyson Zone air purification headphones. It was followed by IBM (174), Jaguar Land Rover (158) and Imagination Technologies Ltd (94).

## Bees that are trained to detect bombs

[https://interestingengineering.com/ie-originals/ie-explainer/season-4/ep-11-bees-that-are-trained-to-detect-bombs](https://interestingengineering.com/ie-originals/ie-explainer/season-4/ep-11-bees-that-are-trained-to-detect-bombs)

- [The bees] are introduced to the scent of explosive vapors, accompanied by a reward of sugary water. Over time, the bees form a remarkable association between the explosive scent and this sweet reward, showcasing their remarkable Proboscis Extension Reflex (PER), which becomes the primary indicator of their detection capabilities. To harness this unique ability, researchers employ two distinct methods, one involving cameras and computer algorithms and the other utilizing an infrared LED system to gauge proboscis extension.
