## Energy, Climate, and the Future

### MIT team makes a case for direct carbon capture from seawater, not air

[https://newatlas.com/environment/mit-carbon-capture-seawater/](https://newatlas.com/environment/mit-carbon-capture-seawater/)

- The ocean currently soaks up some 30-40% of all humanity's annual carbon emissions, and maintains a constant free exchange with the air. Suck the carbon out of the seawater, and it'll suck more out of the air to re-balance the concentrations. Best of all, the concentration of carbon dioxide in seawater is more than 100 times greater than in air.
- "Though our base energy consumption of 122 kJ/mol-CO2 is a record-low," reads the study, "it may still be substantially decreased towards the thermodynamic limit of 32 kJ/mol-CO2.”
- The team projects an optimized cost around US$56 per ton of CO2 captured.

### UK fights energy crisis with 'world's first' shared rooftop panels

[https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/uk-energy-crisis-shared-rooftop-panels](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/uk-energy-crisis-shared-rooftop-panels)

- Residents of Cardiff's Odet Court housing complex U.K. are benefiting from "world-first" technology that allows solar energy from a single rooftop system to be shared by multiple residences in the same building.
- The new solar system setup can supply up to 75 percent of each apartment's power requirements, benefiting the residents, Euronews reported on Saturday.

### Wind-Powered Cargo Ships Are the Future: Debunking 4 Myths That Stand in the Way of Cutting Emissions

- Myth 1: Wind ships are a thing of the past, for good reason
- Myth 2: The wind is unreliable, so ships won’t arrive on time
- Myth 3: Sails cannot work on all types of ships
- Myth 4: If it makes so much sense, we’d already be doing it

### This startup uses grass to build energy-efficient building panels

[https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/startup-engineered-building-materials-grass](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/startup-engineered-building-materials-grass)

- Plantd is building panels for roof decking, wall sheathing, and subflooring. They claim that their product outcompetes wood in every aspect: it's lighter, cheaper, and captures more carbon.
- This rapid-growth plant can reach lengths of 20 - 30 feet in just one year, making it an ideal choice for building materials.

### [Huberman Lab] How Meditation Works & Science-Based Effective Meditations | Episode 96

- **Awareness continuum**: interoception (inside: feeling heart beating, thoughts, etc) vs exteroception (outside: sounds, movement, etc)
    - Notice which way you're biased in the moment and do an opposite meditation, even if only 3 minutes, to train (focus on third eye centre or tree in distance)
- **Types**: focus vs relax (NSDR); internal vs external; active vs passive breathing
- **Examples**
    - _Interoception_: focus on third-eye centre (TEC)
        - Location of prefrontal cortex - as the brain has no sensing mechanisms, focussing on this doesn’t arouse sensations, allowing thoughts/feelings to arise
    - _Exteroception_: watch a tree in the distance
- A wondering mind is an unhappy mind - the more focussed you are on the task at hand the happier you'll be
- **Breathing**
    - Cyclic hyperventilation / Wim Hof breathing / tummo is not meditation but it’s own practise
    - Normal breathing: active inhale and passive exhale
    - An active exhale encourages interoception
    - Longer/more vigorous inhales = alert; exhales = relaxed
    - Any form of active breathing requires focus so is a type of meditation. More complex breathing patterns are more consuming so “more” meditative.
- **Space-time bridging** (STB) meditation
    1. Attention on breathing/TEC for 3 breathes
    2. 50:50 visual focus on hand held out in front and 3 breathes
    3. 50:50 visual focus on something 15m away and 3 breathes
    4. 50:50 visual focus on something very far away and 3 breathes
    5. Close eyes, focus on how small you are in the universe for 3 breathes
    6. Repeat

### [Modern Wisdom] #592 - Richard Shotton - 8 Fascinating Psychological Biases

Activity: Try delabelling/blind taste testing wine etc

- Habit formation - align with natural event e.g. new year, start of week, birthday
- Random/variable rewards builds addiction because people are bad at statistics
- Reduce friction - e.g. default to donate organs, one-click buy
- Add friction - display of effort e.g. Skyscanner
- Add friction - e.g. IKEA effect (you build so you value), c_t is more memorable than cat (your brain has to put in more effort)
- Irregular numbers are more believable - e.g. £10,423 vs £10,000

## Politics, Economics, and Business

### [How I Built This with Guy Raz] Osprey Packs: Mike Pfotenhauer

- Much cheaper and easier to start a business back then - he doesn't think it would be possible now how he did (small store doing it himself).
- Had to offshore later on as no local talent and too expensive, although (unlike other companies) he kept all design in the USA.

### [How I Built This with Guy Raz] HIBT Lab! Boom Supersonic: Blake Scholl

- The founder is the visionary. Their partner/second in command is the pragmatist. When the former retires, the latter takes over. Innovation stops.
- Why isn't this done? Check assumptions. Run the numbers. It’s possible technology has changed and something that wasn't possible now is.
