- What sets the SOFi Hot Cup apart is its unique design featuring three flaps that fold to form a spill-proof spout, eliminating the need for a separate plastic lid. This not only offers cost savings for businesses in terms of money, storage space, and freight, but also significantly reduces plastic waste. The cup's patent-pending locking mechanism offers unparalleled spill protection, while a proprietary water-based coating prevents the unpleasant experience of soggy sips.
