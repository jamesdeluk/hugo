- Increasing levels of CO2 in the Earth’s atmosphere will result in a long-term decline in air density at high altitudes, according to new research from British Antarctic Survey. Such decreased density will reduce drag on objects orbiting in the upper atmosphere, between 90 and 500 km altitude, extending the lifetime of space debris and elevating the risk of collisions between debris and satellites.

- They found that their "bio-battery," which is indigestible, could potentially provide a charge for up to 100 years if configured correctly.
- The fuel cell is about the size of a U.S. dime and is sealed with a strip of Kapton tape, which can endure temperatures between -500 and 750 degrees Fahrenheit. The cell is activated when the tape is removed, and moisture is allowed to enter it. When this happens, the bacteria combined with a chemical germinant are encthe battery can store 6,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity for six hours.er to power an LED, a digital thermometer, or a small clock.
