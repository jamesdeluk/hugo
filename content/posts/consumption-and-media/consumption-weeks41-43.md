## 3MM: Body Positivity, Birth Control & Beliefs - Chris Williamson

- TLDR: Female support for body positivity is at least in-part fuelled deep down by female intrasexual competition, which pushes other women out of the dating pool by discouraging them from losing weight.
- A recent study published in Personality and Individual Differences found that women who are high in intrasexual competitiveness are more likely to advise women who they perceive as a potential mating threat to cut off more hair, potentially in an attempt to sabotage their attractiveness.

## Liebreich: ‘Oil sector is lobbying for inefficient hydrogen cars because it wants to delay electrification’

[https://www.rechargenews.com/energy-transition/liebreich-oil-sector-is-lobbying-for-inefficient-hydrogen-cars-because-it-wants-to-delay-electrification-/2-1-1033226](https://www.rechargenews.com/energy-transition/liebreich-oil-sector-is-lobbying-for-inefficient-hydrogen-cars-because-it-wants-to-delay-electrification-/2-1-1033226)

- “If you're an oil and gas company, in a way, talking about hydrogen is kind of a two-way bet because if it works, then you're embedded in the hydrogen industry — but if it doesn't work, you've delayed the transition to the thing you don't make, which is electricity,”
- Liebreich gives an example of Shell being happy to spend $12bn on a floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) platform, the Prelude, which has seen a host of problems, “but they won't spend $12bn just producing blue, green, pink, or any other sort of clean hydrogen for those [existing] uses where we currently are driving 3-4% of global emissions”.
- “Okay, so you've saved 45 minutes [refilling a hydrogen car at a fuelling station vs recharging an electric car]. The rest of the year, you're back at home and back to your boring commute, and you're driving your 20 miles a day. Well, every time you do 300 miles, you have to go to a hydrogen filling station [unlike a BEV that you can charge at home]. So 40 times a year, you have to waste 10 minutes and maybe more driving to a hydrogen filling station. That's 400 minutes and you've saved yourself 45 minutes on the, maybe, two to five times that you actually drive to your cottage or to the Alps, or wherever. So even on the time spent, on an annual basis, it's not a win, it's a big loss for most people.”

## BRB w/ Nathan P – Microbial Suncreens

[https://nathanpaumier.substack.com/p/brb-w-nathan-p-microbial-suncreens](https://nathanpaumier.substack.com/p/brb-w-nathan-p-microbial-suncreens)

- Oxybenzone is harmful to humans and deadly to corals and phytoplankton. It is still found in 2/3 of sunscreens tested by the EWG in 2019.
- Many microorganisms, fungi, algae, and corals protect themselves from the sun using highly effective molecules called mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs). Commercial sunscreens featuring MAAs are already in market, like MiBelle’s Helioguard 365.
