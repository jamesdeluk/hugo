## TU/e students develop zero emissions car that actually captures CO₂ from the air as it drives

[https://www.tue.nl/en/news-and-events/news-overview/21-07-2022-tue-students-develop-zero-emissions-car-that-actually-captures-co2-from-the-air-as-it-drives](https://www.tue.nl/en/news-and-events/news-overview/21-07-2022-tue-students-develop-zero-emissions-car-that-actually-captures-co2-from-the-air-as-it-drives)

- The car can capture 2 kilograms of CO₂ through a special filter at 20,000 travel miles per year. This means that ten cars can store as much carbon dioxide as an average tree. There are more than a billion passenger cars driving around the world

## New photoreactor technology could pave the way to a carbon-neutral future, researchers say

[https://www.utoronto.ca/news/new-photoreactor-technology-could-pave-way-carbon-neutral-future-researchers-say](https://www.utoronto.ca/news/new-photoreactor-technology-could-pave-way-carbon-neutral-future-researchers-say)

- The innovative design allows the photoreactor to capture photons at high efficiency under varying sun directions, eliminating the need for sun-tracking. The panels are also manufacturable via extrusion of polymers, making them inexpensive and easily manufacturable at scale – all of which could help make a sustainable future more affordable and practical.

## Creating food out of thin air

- "Our process is very similar to growing plants," said Lisa Dyson, founder of Air Protein. "But instead of a multicellular organism, like a plant, [it creates] a single celled organism in a matter of hours. We're essentially feeding the elements that make up that protein molecule to the organism, and the organism reshuffles everything to make that protein.”

## The Era of Ultracheap Stuff Is Under Threat

- Asia, the world’s factory floor and the source of much of the stuff Americans buy, is running into a big problem: Its young people, by and large, don’t want to work in factories.
- “Everybody wants to be an Instagrammer or a photographer or a stylist or work at a coffee shop,” he said.
- In 2001, Nike reported that more than 80% of its factory workers were in Asia, and that the typical one was 22, single and raised on a farm. Today, Nike’s average worker in China is 40, and in Vietnam, 31, in part because Asian countries are aging rapidly.
