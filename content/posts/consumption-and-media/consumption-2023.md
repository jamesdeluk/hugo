## [The Knowledge Project with Shane Parrish] #155 Best of 2022: Conversations of the Year

[https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/best-of-2022/](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/best-of-2022/)

- In India, a country focussed on status, there is 3x margin on living room products (seen by visitors) vs bedroom products (unseen by visitors). A living room (partial) renovation product gets more traction than home (whole) renovation product. Extending this - what is the core driver? [Kunal Shah]
- Impulse control and go/no-go functions: Train no-go circuitry by stopping yourself doing unconscious behaviours/habits e.g. picking up phone without a purpose, changing a plan spontaneously, grabbing a snack. Trained through meditating (”no, I won’t explore this thought right now”). Relates to sitting and focussing on one thing for extended period without any distractions (deep work). [Huberman]

## [Blinkist] One Small Step Can Change Your Life by Robert Maurer

- Questions stimulate thinking. Even if you know you don’t know the answer, regularly ask yourself the question anyway.
- Start small and simple - "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step”.
- Fix small problems and the larger ones may fix themselves.
- Visualise what you want to achieve. If you find visualising hard, start small. For example, in an interview. What will I be wearing?

## Can Planting a Trillion New Trees Save the World?

- [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/magazine/planting-trees-climate-change.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/magazine/planting-trees-climate-change.html)
- Nearly half the land involved was slated to be turned into plantations of fast-growing commercial trees. The carbon these monocultures store is mostly released in a decade or so, when the trees are harvested, the researchers wrote.
- Grassland scientists argue that such areas are not degraded forests, but rather ancient, biodiverse and carbon-rich ecosystems, worthy of protection in their own right. By directing the attention of tree-planting campaigns toward those grasslands, he thought, the map could threaten the existence of countless species and ecosystems.
- Drastically overestimated the climate-mending effects of planting trees. “They did the carbon-accounting equivalent of you or me buying a house for $100K, fixing it up with $50K of improvements, selling it for $200K, then bragging about how we made $200K in profit,” he says.
- They are planting seeds or seedlings, which offer few benefits and are not tough at all. Every year, he recalls, the government provided seedlings for the class to plant, and all their planted seedlings always died. “We should be growing trees, not planting trees,”
- The movement’s success or failure in restoring the world’s forests will be judged not by the number of trees planted, but via satellite imagery, viewed over the long term, and discussed the old-fashioned way — in hectares.

## Protecting Ourselves From Inflation [10-K Diver]

- [https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1528374195201052674](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1528374195201052674)
- 3 economic characteristics that tend to make companies robust to inflation:
    - Pricing power
        - A company has pricing power if it can raise the price of its products and services -- and still not see a reduction in demand for them. Usually, this happens when customers consider the company's products/services *essential* -- with NO adequate substitute.
        - Companies that have such pricing power tend to leave clues in their financial statements:
            - High gross margins and operating margins,
            - High returns on invested capital, and
            - High Free Cash Flow conversion (ie, owners can take out most of their *earnings* in *cash*)
    - Capital lightness, and
        - If capital heavy, much of their "earnings" may simply go towards increasing their own "capital" -- which is *required* for these very earnings!
    - Judicious use of debt.
        - Inflation helps *borrowers*. That's because they get to borrow money in today's (more valuable) dollars -- and pay it back using tomorrow's (less valuable) dollars.

## What’s next for batteries

- [https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/01/04/1066141/whats-next-for-batteries/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/01/04/1066141/whats-next-for-batteries/)
- Solid-state batteries can use a wide range of chemistries, but a leading candidate for commercialization uses lithium metal.
- Sodium-ion batteries may not improve performance, but they could cut costs because they rely on cheaper, more widely available materials than lithium-ion chemistries do.
- Form Energy is developing an iron-air battery that uses a water-based electrolyte and basically stores energy using reversible rusting.
- This year could be a breakout year for one alternative: lithium iron phosphate (LFP), a low-cost cathode material
- Most anodes in lithium-ion batteries today, whatever their cathode makeup, use graphite to hold the lithium ions. But alternatives like silicon could help increase energy density and speed up charging.

## This Is Why Global Warming Is Responsible For Freezing Temperatures Across The U.S.

- [https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/01/30/this-is-why-global-warming-is-responsible-for-freezing-temperatures-across-the-usa/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/01/30/this-is-why-global-warming-is-responsible-for-freezing-temperatures-across-the-usa/)

- https://www.greenmatters.com/weather-and-global-warming/does-global-warming-make-winter-colder
- Global warming can cause harsh winter weather in other ways too. Warmer temperatures mean a warmer atmosphere. National Geographic explains that when an atmosphere is warmer, it can hold more moisture which causes an increase in precipitation — hence more snowfall when temperatures are below freezing. This can cause blizzards to be more intense.
- Perhaps paradoxically, it's a strong, extremely cold polar vortex that results in stable, warm temperatures across the more populous mid-latitudes in winter.

## [The Big Green Money Show] How to Recycle: With Biffa CEO

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001d7bx](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001d7bx)

- Closed loop - plastic bottle to plastic bottle (in about 2 weeks).
- Bottle is ~50% recycled but only because not enough recycled material available.
- Waste management is 8% of UK emissions.
- Single material packaging is key - even if all plastic.
- Business model: Paid to process by government, but some profits from end products sold go back to government.
- Tips: Rinse in cold water; don't remove labels; keep plastic lids on (colour and type sorting machinery handles); leave plastic on cardboard box/envelope (machines separate).
- Listening made me positive about achieving something?

## New EV entrants disrupt Europe’s automotive market

- The new entrants, however, have chosen vastly different GTM strategies. These range from direct-to-consumer (DTC) strategies that feature their own outlets (such as NIO and Lynk & Co.), strategic partnerships with importers for wholesale distribution (for example, BYD), pure importer models (for instance, Skywell) and partnerships with non-automotive retailers (such as Aiways that has partnered with an electronics retailer in Germany).

- Lifestyle and habits auditing: Record all daily actions, were they done by the best you or the worst you? You become what you do.
- Daily reflection: What drained me? What did I learn? What am I grateful for? What excited me? How did I push the needle forward?
- To make a decision - Rather than pros and cons, imagine worst and best possibly outcomes/experiences
- To stop catastrophising - Which is the most likely outcome? Would I put money on it?

## [The Tim Ferriss Show] #648: James Clear, Atomic Habits

[https://tim.blog/2023/01/06/james-clear-atomic-habits/](https://tim.blog/2023/01/06/james-clear-atomic-habits/)

- The bad days matter more than the good days. Even if you only do 10% of what you hoped, that's still more than 0.
- Content creation and marketing:
    - A blog post can lead to a podcast which can lead to a TV interview which can lead to huge sales. It all starts by putting something out there.
    - Be aware of letting other platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) own your content and audience and leads. You could easily lose control.
    - Create to help - be thoughtful and genuine.
    - Personalise marketing materials e.g. “you might like this part”
- Habits:
    - Build an identity by doing the actions that identity would do e.g. “I am the type of person who goes to the gym every day”
    - How you spend your time demonstrates your priorities.
    - Building a habit: Make it obvious, attractive, easy, satisfying. Find how by asking questions: “How can this be easy?" e.g. Meditation: a ॐ poster, a comfy chair, start with 60 seconds, eat chocolate after
    - Have pre-activity rituals to preprogramme action. e.g. Music when getting ready for the gym.

- He took advantage of loopholes and questionable activities, and kept a low profile.
    - But how did it find them? That would be the really useful thing to know.

## [Brave New Earth] E7: How Vertical Farms are changing the food we eat... w. Alexander Olesen, Founder of Babylon Microfarms

- Alex predicts vertical farming to be a major contributor to low-calorie greens within 5 years.

- May need to position at premium level (think Tesla) due to higher costs.

## [My First Million] Announcing This Year's Episode of the Year: Camp MFM Recap

## [Modern Wisdom] #577 - David Goggins

- Everything is a chain of one-second decisions, single steps. Overcome each one.
- Pain is temporary, gain lasts forever.
- Don't assume others are better than you - that they have their shit together, their opinions are all well considered, they love their life. You only see the outside.
- You need an organised mind to be disciplined. Achieve one by meditating and reducing input (consumption).
- Everyday résumé. Affirmations are outweighed by actions. Don’t tell yourself you’ll do something; prove it to yourself.

## [Founders] #276 Paul Graham’s Essays part 2

- Conventional- vs independent-minded continuum. To increase the latter, spend time with independently-minded thinkers - those who ask why it can't be done, not those who assume it can't be.
- Follow your curiosity and interest. Curiosity gives energy. Work should feel fun.
- You have to work hard to be successful. There are no shortcuts. Working smart is not enough.

## The Joe Rogan Experience - #1928 - Jimmy Corsetti & Ben van Kerkwyk

- The overall theory seems solid. Lost civilisations (including Atlantis) who had now-lost advanced technology, potentially killed by extra-terrestrial impact and/or climate and/or cataclysmic pole shift.
- Some of the convo is a bit too conspiratorial e.g. with Elon, COVID, anti-Leftism, etc., as Rogan often is now.

## [Cautionary Tales with Tim Harford] LIVE: The Myth of the Million Dollar Tulip Bulb

- Mackay's famous *Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds* book is bullshit. In reality, the Tulip Mania was tiny, mostly among rich people collecting them for bragging purposes (like NFTs are today), and it caused no real financial problems. On the other hand, he said the Railway Mania of the 1800s was not a bubble, and yet in reality it crashed the economy.
- Predicting a bubble is easy in hindsight, but difficult in the moment. High debt levels are one key factor that can cause a crash. But there needs to be a spark.

## [Acquired] The Playbook: Lessons from 200+ Company Stories

- Tech is exponential, hence huge gains. What else can be?
- If you're told not to do something “for your own good”, question if there is a hidden motive, e.g. Nvidia’s broken functions.
- It's only recent where most founders are kids. Traditionally it was older experienced people. It's not too late.
- Be a utility - something others need to run their business and make money.
    - AWS. Energy.
- Aim for mass appeal or go very niche - don't sit in the middle. The internet enables niches, although it can take time to build an audience.

[https://youtu.be/gg5MdeC6qzI /](https://youtu.be/gg5MdeC6qzI) [https://youtu.be/8pM9o2Ifcro](https://youtu.be/8pM9o2Ifcro)

- Quieter
    - EV tyres use multiple sound-deadening techniques because EV drivetrains are quieter meaning tyre noise is a higher % of overall noise.
- Handling
    - EV tyres are stiffer and harder to counteract distortion due to added weight when turning, braking, acceleration.
    - EV tyres need smaller grooves to disperse water as weight of EV counteracts.
- Efficiency
    - Reduced rolling resistance through manufacturing techniques to maximise EV range.

- The traditional PV tiles are made from a polymer compound, which allows the sun's rays to filter through. The photovoltaic cells are then integrated into it by hand and covered with a layer of the polymer compound. "We can also give it the look of stone, wood, concrete, and brick. As a result, such a solution can be installed not only on roofs but also on walls and floors,"

## Say Hello To The Floating Farm In Rotterdam

[https://cleantechnica.com/2023/01/20/say-hello-to-the-floating-farm-in-rotterdam/](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/01/20/say-hello-to-the-floating-farm-in-rotterdam/)

- Today, the couple’s Floating Farm bobs in the harbor at Rotterdam, where it is home to 40 Maas-Rijn-Ijssel cows, who collectively produce some 200 gallons (757 liters) of milk a day.
    - *JG: I do feel a bit bad for the cows though - they need more space.*
- Plans are in the works for a floating vegetable farm to move into the space next to the current Floating Farm. Permit applications are also out for similar structures in Dubai, Singapore, and the Dutch cities of Haarlem and Arnhem.
- Should a weather crisis arise, a waterborne farm isn’t necessarily stuck in place. An urban farm that serves city dwellers also reduces carbon emissions associated with food transportation. Furthermore, a farm that floats on water also helps to take a little pressure off the “global land squeeze,”

## A new integrated cost-effective carbon capture and conversion system

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOi7Bfw9rrs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOi7Bfw9rrs)

- The system takes flue gas from power plants, and strips out CO2 using a patented
PNNL-developed solvent. The solvent then carries the captured CO2 to a reactor, where it is converted into methanol, one of the most widely produced industrial chemicals on Earth. This continuous process skips multiple expensive steps to release, compress, and purify the CO2. By eliminating the need for two separate plants, and shipping and piping the CO2, PNNL has significantly reduced the cost to make renewable methanol.
- Plant operators could sell the methanol to cover the cost of capturing and converting the CO2.

## How A Brick & Rock Battery Is Changing Energy Storage

[https://youtu.be/B3JlTVt0jLw](https://youtu.be/B3JlTVt0jLw)

- Rondo: Heats bricks to 1500°C which can stay hot for hours/days and are used to create steam for industrial processes. Lifespan of 40 years. Claims of 50-90% reduced emissions and 30%+ reduced costs.
- Brenmiller: 100-500°C, crushed rocks instead of bricks.
- Not hot enough for steel (1600°C) or cement - yet.

## [CleanTechies Podcast] #79 - Re-Engineering the World because the Future is Decarbonized w/ Matt Ward (4Ward.VC)

## How My Views on Learning Have Changed Over Time

[https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/01/17/revised-views-learning/](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/01/17/revised-views-learning/)

- Reading this literature has made me more supportive of Direct Instruction for learning. DI is a teaching philosophy that involves breaking down complex skills into simple concepts and actions, teaching with ample examples and practice.
- While practice is good, examples are too! Watching other people perform a skill, especially with explanations for their decisions, is central to learning well. Similarly, while effortful practice is often necessary, not all effort is worthwhile. I now believe a lot of student struggles are wasteful—failures of instructors to provide thorough examples and explanations rather than a sign that deeper learning is taking place.

- Context 1: Your friends were late for the party, so you could wait for them, or go in alone.
- Context 2: You want to leave the dancefloor, your friends want to stay. Staying because you think your friends will be upset is treating them as babies, and staying is passive/avoidant.
- _JG: Not every situation can have each of the four options (it’s not like MECE), but the overarching concept of active vs passive/avoidant and selfish vs agreeable is an interesting one. Agreeable and/or active also often includes the uncomfortable options - so being an adult is doing the “right” thing, however uncomfortable._

## New Research Reveals 9 Secrets That Will Make You An Expert Negotiator

[https://bakadesuyo.com/2022/11/negotiator/](https://bakadesuyo.com/2022/11/negotiator/)

- **Leverage**: Preparation is vital. Leverage comes from knowing what they need. The person that is more comfortable with “no deal” usually has more leverage.
- **Goals**: Make them specific and aim high. Use recognized third-party sources or the other side’s previous deals. This will give you confidence and reduce fear.
- **Negotiate Process**: Make sure they have the authority to say yes. Establish that information exchange is not binding. “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.”
- **Establish and Maintain Trust**: If you tell me a drought is coming and my first instinct is to buy a canoe, I’m walking away. Lack of trust can kill even the best deals.
- **Information Exchange**: Listening = more leverage. You want them to tell you what they want and why they want it. Don’t go zero-sum; expand the pie and create value. What are low-cost ways to give the other side more things they want so you can justify more things you want? If you have any dealbreakers, you want to mention them early.
- **Offers**: If you don’t have good information, let them make the first offer. If you have good information, go first. Ask for the most you can justify (anchor high). Don’t be too reasonable at first — most people expect a back and forth.
- **Concessions**: Link them with “if…then.” Make sure they recognize you’re giving up something of value so they feel the need to reciprocate.
- **When Things Break Down**: Don’t make ultimatums if you don’t have to. Ignore their ultimatums. If it gets ugly, involve a third party. Say emotions, don’t show them.
- **Closing And Commitment**: You want them to feel happy. This creates follow through and better subsequent negotiations. Get it in writing/with a deposit to stop back-tracking.

## [Huberman Lab] Jocko Willink: How to Become Resilient, Forge Your Identity & Lead Others

- You don't need calories before exercise - adrenaline is more important. That’s why exercise creates energy.
- At first long cardio exercise is uncomfortable, but after a while the repetitive motion allows you to forget the motor movements (central pattern generators) and you can often feel as if you can go on forever. Stick out the first few minutes.
- How quick do you get back to emotional baseline and keep on focussed on the goal? Very important for leaders, and being able to help the team do the same. After a success, celebrate then move on. After a failure, commiserate then move on. Don't let the future be too affected by the past.
    - Candle analogy: The flame can be big (after a success) or small (after a failure) and the amount of fuel needs to be adjusted to keep it level and stop it burning out of control or going out. A success adds fuel, but be careful not to let it burn up too fast.
- If nothing is moving forward, try and step back and look strategically at the big picture. Even if it's not your responsibility - perhaps everyone is else also too focussed/narrow-sighted and you're the only one who realises someone needs to look at the big picture. This can be done physically: widen your field of view, step back (physically), take a breath. This also applies in arguments/conflicts.

## What Does Fiber Do, And Do You Need More?

[https://www.marksdailyapple.com/what-does-fiber-do/](https://www.marksdailyapple.com/what-does-fiber-do/?utm_source=pocket_reader)

- Insoluble fiber is a bulking agent, increasing the mass of the stool, which moves the stool more quickly through the intestines. I’m unconvinced that insoluble fiber has much to offer in terms of health benefits.
- Soluble fiber enhances the thickness of the stomach’s contents. This slows stomach emptying, which can give the body more time to absorb nutrients. More importantly, most types of soluble fiber are fermentable by gut microbes, which supports a healthy and diverse microbiome.
- A recent meta-analysis concluded that while increasing insoluble dietary fiber does increase the frequency of bowel movements, it does nothing for stool consistency, treatment success, laxative use, and painful defecation.
- The better way to increase your consumption of soluble, fermentable fiber is to eat plenty of vegetables, the more variety the better. You can throw in some legumes if they’re part of your repertoire (watch your total carb intake), but it’s not necessary. Top it off with some fermented dairy like full-fat kefir or yogurt.

## A Two-Part Look at: 1. Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises, and 2. How They Apply to What’s Happening Now

[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/two-part-look-1-principles-navigating-big-debt-crises-ray-dalio/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/two-part-look-1-principles-navigating-big-debt-crises-ray-dalio/)

- Borrower-debtors ultimately require enough money and low enough interest rates for them to be able to borrow and service their debts.
- Lender-creditors require high enough interest rates and low enough default rates from the debtors in order for them to get adequate returns to lend and be creditors.
- This balancing act becomes progressively more difficult as the sizes of the debt assets and debt liabilities increase relative to the incomes.
- A “beautiful deleveraging” [1) restructure the debts so debt service payments are spread out over more time or disposed of (which is deflationary and depressing) and 2) have central banks print money and buy debt (which is inflationary and stimulating)] can be engineered by central governments and central banks to reduce debt burdens if the debt is in their own currencies.
- If you know where in the credit-debt cycle each country is and how the players are likely to behave, you should be able to navigate these cycles pretty well.

## Why Is Denmark So Rich Despite Huge Taxes?

[https://youtu.be/fE8flS-vXxE](https://youtu.be/fE8flS-vXxE)

## TikTok May Be A Chinese Superweapon

[https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/tiktok-may-be-a-chinese-bio-weapon](https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/tiktok-may-be-a-chinese-bio-weapon?utm_source=pocket_reader)

- TikTok’s capacity to stupefy people, both acutely by encouraging idiotic behavior, and chronically by atrophying the brain, should prompt consideration of its potential use as a new kind of weapon, one that seeks to neutralize enemies not by inflicting pain and terror, but by inflicting pleasure.
- The US is a paradox composed of contradictions: its two primary values—freedom and equality—are mutually exclusive. It has many different cultures, and therefore no overall culture. And its market-driven society has given it economic riches but spiritual poverty. As he writes in the book, “American institutions, culture and values oppose the United States itself.”
- Western capitalism can be compared to a “paperclip maximizer,” a hypothetical AI programmed by a paperclip business to produce as many paperclips as possible, which leads it to begin recycling everything on earth into paperclips (i.e. commodities). When the programmers panic and try to switch it off, the AI turns them into paperclips, since being switched off would stop it fulfilling its goal of creating as many paperclips as possible. Thus, the blind application of short term goals leads to long term ruin.
- “Human flesh, sex, knowledge, politics, power, and law can all become the target of commodification. Commodification devours meaning and purpose, and to plug the expanding spiritual hole that this leaves, Americans turn to momentary pleasures—drugs, fast food, and amusements—driving the nation further into decadence and decay.”
- For Xi and the CCP, eliminating “decadent” TikTok-style content from China is a matter of survival, because such content is considered a herald of nihilism, a regression of humans back to beasts, a symptom of the West’s terminal illness that must be prevented from metastasizing to China.
- And this is why TikTok could prove such a devastating geopolitical weapon. Slowly but steadily it could turn the West’s youth—its future—into perpetually distracted dopamine junkies ill-equipped to maintain the civilization built by their ancestors.
- In a survey asking American and Chinese children what job they most wanted, the top answer among Chinese kids was “astronaut,” and the top answer among American kids was “influencer.”

- Kelp exists further north where the water has more nutrients that are easily absorbed. Coral exists nearer the equator where the water is more barren (hence why it is beautifully clear). Coral is an animal that eats, plus can photosynthesise through its friends. Seagrass exists where the others don’t.

## Temperature-sensing building material changes color to save energy

[https://pme.uchicago.edu/news/temperature-sensing-building-material-changes-color-save-energy](https://pme.uchicago.edu/news/temperature-sensing-building-material-changes-color-save-energy)

- On hot days, the material can emit up to 92 percent of the infrared heat it contains, helping cool the inside of a building. On colder days, however, the material emits just 7 percent of its infrared, helping keep a building warm.
- Hsu and colleagues designed a non-flammable “electrochromic” building material that contains a layer that can take on two conformations: solid copper that retains most infrared heat, or a watery solution that emits infrared. At any chosen trigger temperature, the device can use a tiny amount of electricity to induce the chemical shift between the states by either depositing copper into a thin film, or stripping that copper off.

## Novel adaptation for existing blast furnaces could reduce steelmaking emissions by 90%

- This radical reduction is achieved through a ‘closed loop’ carbon recycling system, which could replace 90% of the coke typically used in current blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace systems.
- Under a high concentration of CO2, the perovskite splits CO2 into oxygen, which is absorbed into the lattice, and CO, which is fed back into the blast furnace.

## 10 Mental Models for Learning

- The average American in 2018 spent 11 hours every day on solitary activities such as watching television and listening to the radio. Spending 58 days over 29 years with a friend is infinitesimal compared with the 4,851 days that Americans will spend interacting with media during that same time period.
- Repeatedly, when the participants in our study reached old age, they would make a point to say that what they treasured most were their relationships.

## The Secret to Making New Friends as an Adult | Marisa G. Franco | TED

[https://youtu.be/-k0p-DYYZKU](https://youtu.be/-k0p-DYYZKU)

- Friendship doesn’t happen organically in adulthood - you have to be proactive.
- We’re less likely to be rejected than we think (see [this](https://www.jamesgibbins.com/posts/consumption-week4/#9-mental-distortions-that-are-sabotaging-your-social-life) from last week) - so assume people like you (which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy).
- Intimate, relational (friends), and group/community friendships - you need all three.
- Built through repeated unplanned interactions and shared vulnerability.
    - The Like Switch by Jack Schafer: Proximity, frequency, duration, intensity.
- Have activities to be doing, and invite new people to them.
- Have a group you can regularly attend to join the community.

- Another year? Except for the placement of the months (in blue) in the upper-right corner of the one-page calendar, everything else is always the same, year-after-year. Moreover, the way the months are placed shifts in an extremely predictable, repeating pattern. There are only 14 possible calendar configurations: one for each of the seven non-leap years where January 1st begins on each of the seven days of the week, and one for each of the seven leap years where January 1st begins on each possible day of the week. The same calendar that works in 2023 will also work again in 2034, 2045, 2051, 2062, 2073, 2079, 2090, 2102, 2113, and 2119.

## Researchers Create Hydrogen From Seawater Without Pre-Treatment

[https://cleantechnica.com/2023/02/04/researchers-create-hydrogen-from-seawater-without-pre-treatment/](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/02/04/researchers-create-hydrogen-from-seawater-without-pre-treatment/)

- Researchers at the University of Adelaide say they have a solution. According to a report published January 30 in the journal Nature Energy, the team has succeeded in making hydrogen directly from seawater in a process that uses cheap, plentiful catalysts like cobalt oxide with chromium oxide on its surface as the catalyst.
- “We have split natural seawater into oxygen and hydrogen with nearly 100 per cent efficiency, to produce green hydrogen by electrolysis, using a non-precious and cheap catalyst in a commercial electrolyser,”

## Ultra-Thin Solar Panel Coatings

- This allows it to be self-cleaning and repel dirt with the basis of a substance known as crystalline titanium oxide. It is placed on the glass through a roll-to-roll process to allow the solar panels to turn into a super-hydrophilic surface from hydrophobic after it is exposed to ultraviolet light.

## Carbon Removal Startup InPlanet Raises €1.2m In Pre-Seed Funding To Scale Enhanced Rock Weathering Projects

[https://cleantechnica.com/2023/02/08/carbon-removal-startup-inplanet-raises-e1-2m-in-pre-seed-funding-to-scale-enhanced-rock-weathering-projects/](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/02/08/carbon-removal-startup-inplanet-raises-e1-2m-in-pre-seed-funding-to-scale-enhanced-rock-weathering-projects/)

- Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) is a promising new method of CDR, in which silicate rocks are pulverized and spread onto farmland soil. The rock particles react with water and CO2 in the soil to form dissolved bicarbonates, which eventually wash away through water systems and river streams into the ocean. Here, they are deposited as carbonates on the ocean floor to be sequestered in the form of sediments for millions of years.

[https://electrek.co/2023/02/08/wind-turbine-recycle-blades/](https://electrek.co/2023/02/08/wind-turbine-recycle-blades/)

- Vestas says it has discovered a solution that “renders epoxy-based turbine blades as circular, without the need for changing the design or composition of blade material.”
- Once this new technology is implemented at scale, legacy blade material currently sitting in landfill, as well as blade material in active wind farms, can be disassembled and reused.

## Vertical solar panels could save farm land and transform agriculture

- Sunzuan's ingenuity lies in the use of bifacial solar modules in its design which negates the need to install the panels in a south-facing configuration [JG: in the northern hemisphere].
- They can be used in existing fields and arable lands without sacrificing them and make it simpler to install the solar panels since no elevated platforms need to be built.

- He learnt of huge lithium deposits in South America on holiday that were not being fully utilised efficiently/not known much to outsiders. Aware of a market trend (the need for lithium), he became curious, researched and learnt as much as he could, to find how he could improve the process. He asked a friend in a related industry. He contacted people in the industry, including uni professors doing research whose technology he licenced. He cold emailed lithium producers to see market size and find future customers.
- Initially self-funded, ~$100,000 ($60k travel, $40k licencing)
- "Why is it done this way?" "Because this it the way it's always been done" → Opportunity.
    - Try applying existing technologies to new use cases after understanding the current process and it's flaws
- According to LinkedIn, he studied business and then at Singularity Uni, started own business straight out of uni, presumably made decent money (hence self-funding): [https://www.linkedin.com/in/teagueegan/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teagueegan/)

## Why Smart People Hold Stupid Beliefs

[https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/why-smart-people-hold-stupid-beliefs](https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/why-smart-people-hold-stupid-beliefs)

- While unintelligent people are more easily misled by other people, intelligent people are more easily misled by themselves. They’re better at convincing themselves of things they want to believe rather than things that are actually true. This is why intelligent people tend to have stronger ideological biases; being better at reasoning makes them better at rationalizing.
- For centuries, elite academic institutions like Oxford and Harvard have been training their students to win arguments but not to discern truth, and in so doing, they’ve created a class of people highly skilled at motivated reasoning. The master-debaters that emerge from these institutions go on to become tomorrow’s elites—politicians, entertainers, and intellectuals.
- If a wokeist wishes to use the overrepresentation of white men in STEM as evidence that women and minorities are being discriminated against, then the wokeist must either ignore or explain away the fact that Asian men are also overrepresented in STEM, or that women dominate the field of psychology, or that the biggest racial disparity of all is black men comprising less than 7% of the US population but holding over 70% of dream jobs playing in the NBA.
- Not only does intelligence in the service of wokeism lead to one-sided readings of reality, it also leads to the production of pure fiction. For instance, the common myth that black people are underrepresented in film (they’re [overrepresented](https://socialsciences.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/UCLA-Hollywood-Diversity-Report-2018-2-27-18.pdf)), the common myth that hate crimes are increasing (I [Gurwinder] debunked that [here](https://rabbitholemag.com/how-progress-blinds-people-to-progress/)), the common myth that white people are particularly prejudiced (I [Gurwinder] debunked that [here](https://rabbitholemag.com/antiracism-is-racist/)), and the common myth that rape is not about sex but power (I [Gurwinder] debunked that [here](https://rabbitholemag.com/no-rape-and-sexual-harassment-arent-about-power/)).
- There is only one thing that can motivate us to put our intelligence into the service of objective truth, and that is curiosity. Enter the [curiosity zone](https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/curiosity-zone).

## Part 2 of a Two-Part Look at: 1. Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises, and 2. How These Principles Apply to What’s Happening Now

[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/part-2-two-part-look-1-principles-navigating-big-debt-ray-dalio/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/part-2-two-part-look-1-principles-navigating-big-debt-ray-dalio/)

- “Short-term debt cycle”: 1) recessions that lead to 2) central banks providing a lot of credit, which creates a lot of debt that initially leads to 3) market and economic booms that lead to 4) bubbles and inflations, which lead to 5) central bankers tightening credit that leads to 6) market and economic weakening. There have been 12.5 of these since 1945.
- “Long-term debt cycle,”: the cycle of building up debt assets and debt liabilities over long periods of time to amounts that eventually become unmanageable. This leads to a combination of big debt restructurings and big debt monetizations that produce a period of big market and economic turbulence. I believe that we are now roughly about 85% through the one that began in 1945.
- The world as a whole [is] in what I call Stage 5 of the Big Cycle—i.e., near the brinks of financial/economic crises and big internal conflicts/wars, and in the early part of an evolving, costly climate crisis—at the same time as the world is near the brink of having amazing technological breakthroughs that will affect our daily lives. Stage 5 is the last-chance stage before going into Stage 6 which is the financial crisis and war part of the cycle. It seems to me that that will make the environment very challenging for those who are following the traditional leveraged long approach to investing in traditional areas, while it will provide great opportunities in those geographic and subject areas that are benefiting from these changes [e.g. China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, UAE, Saudi Arabia]
- I now estimate the probability of a profoundly disruptive civil war to be about 35-40% and the probability of a profoundly disruptive international war also being about 35-40% over the next 10 years. I expect the United States and China to avoid an all-out military war.

## Eliminating Cash: A Great or Terrible Idea?

[https://youtu.be/MBnHRGsvA_4](https://youtu.be/MBnHRGsvA_4)

## Investing STILL Won't Make You Rich (Probably)

[https://youtu.be/H5jPJQ5cVGU](https://youtu.be/H5jPJQ5cVGU)

- After tax/inflation, average S&P return is 5.4% (not ~10%), so $10,000 invested with +$3000 a year would take 52.8 years to reach $1,000,000 (based on my maths at 10% it would take just ~35 years).
- Most wealthy people, in reality: own a business (including social media scammy “get rich quick” schemes), very high salary, inheritance

## Bullshit Jobs - David Graeber

- 4/5
- Trading time instead of output for money is a fairly modern concept, and is depressing. You can’t appear to not be working, so you have to pretend. Because of this you can’t deeply focus on something productive, such as studying something unrelated to the job you’re being paid for, or eading a book. Instead you’re limited to short, shallow consumption, such as social media, Reddit, etc. It often results in busywork or twiddling thumbs. Given we’re all going to die, wasting time in this way is an uncomfortable feeling.

## MIT team makes a case for direct carbon capture from seawater, not air

[https://newatlas.com/environment/mit-carbon-capture-seawater/](https://newatlas.com/environment/mit-carbon-capture-seawater/)

- The ocean currently soaks up some 30-40% of all humanity's annual carbon emissions, and maintains a constant free exchange with the air. Suck the carbon out of the seawater, and it'll suck more out of the air to re-balance the concentrations. Best of all, the concentration of carbon dioxide in seawater is more than 100 times greater than in air.
- "Though our base energy consumption of 122 kJ/mol-CO2 is a record-low," reads the study, "it may still be substantially decreased towards the thermodynamic limit of 32 kJ/mol-CO2.”
- The team projects an optimized cost around US$56 per ton of CO2 captured.

## [Huberman Lab] How Meditation Works & Science-Based Effective Meditations | Episode 96

- **Awareness continuum**: interoception (inside: feeling heart beating, thoughts, etc) vs exteroception (outside: sounds, movement, etc)
    - Notice which way you're biased in the moment and do an opposite meditation, even if only 3 minutes, to train (focus on third eye centre or tree in distance)
- **Types**: focus vs relax (NSDR); internal vs external; active vs passive breathing
- **Examples**
    - _Interoception_: focus on third-eye centre (TEC)
        - Location of prefrontal cortex - as the brain has no sensing mechanisms, focussing on this doesn’t arouse sensations, allowing thoughts/feelings to arise
    - _Exteroception_: watch a tree in the distance
- A wondering mind is an unhappy mind - the more focussed you are on the task at hand the happier you'll be
- **Breathing**
    - Cyclic hyperventilation / Wim Hof breathing / tummo is not meditation but it’s own practise
    - Normal breathing: active inhale and passive exhale
    - An active exhale encourages interoception
    - Longer/more vigorous inhales = alert; exhales = relaxed
    - Any form of active breathing requires focus so is a type of meditation. More complex breathing patterns are more consuming so “more” meditative.
- **Space-time bridging** (STB) meditation
    1. Attention on breathing/TEC for 3 breathes
    2. 50:50 visual focus on hand held out in front and 3 breathes
    3. 50:50 visual focus on something 15m away and 3 breathes
    4. 50:50 visual focus on something very far away and 3 breathes
    5. Close eyes, focus on how small you are in the universe for 3 breathes
    6. Repeat

- Habit formation - align with natural event e.g. new year, start of week, birthday
- Random/variable rewards builds addiction because people are bad at statistics
- Reduce friction - e.g. default to donate organs, one-click buy
- Add friction - display of effort e.g. Skyscanner
- Add friction - e.g. IKEA effect (you build so you value), c_t is more memorable than cat (your brain has to put in more effort)
- Irregular numbers are more believable - e.g. £10,423 vs £10,000

## Materials breakthrough: An anti-corrosive polymer that self-heals and is recyclable

[https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/anti-corrosive-polymer-self-heals-recyclable](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/anti-corrosive-polymer-self-heals-recyclable)

- The material, PPM, can be sprayed onto a surface and becomes solid when mixed with paint and heat. "The polymer indicates holes and cracks in the protective layer by failing to fluoresce. What’s more, it repairs any damage itself without further external intervention,”
- The recycling rate which is rated at 95 percent, makes it more sustainable than previous corrosion protection materials. The team was able to reuse the material five times.

## Recapturing excess heat could power most of Europe, say experts

[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/23/recapturing-excess-heat-could-power-most-of-europe-say-experts](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/23/recapturing-excess-heat-could-power-most-of-europe-say-experts)

- Global engineering company Danfoss estimated that in the EU alone, excess heat was equal to 2,860 TWh a year, almost the same as the EU’s total energy demand for heat and hot water.
- Surplus heat is released into the air from a wide range of sources, including supermarkets, transport networks, data centres and commercial buildings. Much of this can be captured and used via existing heat recovery technologies, such as heat pumps, plus more efficient air conditioners and manufacturing machinery.

## Creativity is Productivity

[https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/02/28/creativity-is-productivity/](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/02/28/creativity-is-productivity/)

- The randomness of creative success favors those who are the most prolific. Price’s Law captures this relationship in scientific output, estimating that half of the research of a given discipline will be produced by the square root of the number of researchers. So in a field with 100 contributors, ten will produce half of the published output. If every paper in the field has a roughly equal probability of being cited [Dean Simonton has analyzed the creative output of individuals across many domains and suggests an “equal-odds” rule best describes it: once a creative individual starts publishing in a field, each piece of work they produce has roughly equal odds of world-breaking impact.], these ten highly prolific authors will capture approximately half of all citations in their field.
- We prefer to attach creative success to a combination of innate talent, acquired ability and passionate commitment. (Yet) Over a surprisingly wide range of pursuits, creativity is productivity, and we will have more hits if we take more swings.

## [Huberman Lab] How to Breathe Correctly for Optimal Health, Mood, Learning & Performance

[https://youtu.be/x4m_PdFbu-s](https://youtu.be/x4m_PdFbu-s)

- Breathing is better than meditation for reducing stress, with cyclic sighing the best (box breathing is also good). Even 1 physiological sigh can reduce stress. Five minutes is great.
- Inhale:exhale ratio can control heart rate (and sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous system, and hence stress)
    - Inhaling: increased heart rate, faster reaction times, better memory
    - Exhaling: decreased heart rate
- Hyperventilation causes O2 to increase and CO2 to decrease. But CO2 is needed to absorb O2, so when you hyperventilate the brain gets 30-40% less O2, which is what causes you to get hyper excitable and feel alert - but actually you function worse.
- CO2 blow-off time test and box breathing
    - Take a deep breathe through your nose then breathe out through your mouth as slowly as possible and measure how long you can last: <20s, 20-40s, >40s.
    - Box breathing for 4s, 6s, 8s respectively.
- Breathing through your nose is harder (smaller passage so higher pressure), but because of this higher pressure you can take deeper breathes.
- Physiological sighing 2-3 times can remove right side stitch when running (not left, that's about air/fluid in stomach).
- Stop hiccups: 3 inhales through nose then hold 15s
- JG: I've always naturally breathed slowly and paused after each exhale. Most "slow" breathes in guided meditations are actually fast for me. Seems I'm actually breathing very healthily, and that this isn't the norm. I wonder why? I wonder if a rural upbringing is partially responsible?

## [The Jordan Harbinger Show] 803: Martin Seligman | Flourishing in an Uncertain Future

- People with positive emotions live 6-8 years longer.
    - Being kind is the best way to improve your emotions.
- Pleasure comes from action - striving and succeeding.
- Optimists vs pessimists
    - Optimists: think it is temporary and act to change it, will try harder.
    - Pessimists: assume a bad situation will last forever.
- How to react
    - To good things: find permanent/pervasive/personal causes
    - To bad things: find temporary/local causes, and ones you can control
- Optimism vs positive emotions
    - Being jolly protects against infectious illness, but optimism doesn’t.
    - Optimism protects against cardiovascular illness, but being jolly doesn't
- Meaning vs mattering
    - Hard to develop your meaning - the existential questions.
    - Easier to feel like your matter - receiving appreciation/thanks → how to be a good manager.
- How to give active constructive appreciation (not “well done”)
    - Demonstrate you understand the context
    - Get them to retell the story/emotions (relive it)

- We looked at the skills that employers requested in job postings each year and compared those skills with the ones requested for the same occupation in 2016. We broke down the change in two ways. First, we looked at the skills that were completely new to jobs—the ones that employers didn’t ask for at all in 2016. Then, we looked at whether skills became more or less important to a role. The Skill Disruption Index, which combines the two measures, allows us to compare how rapid and significant the changes are in specific roles.
- We see four big trends in skill change:
    - Digital skills, like technical fluency and abilities including data analysis, digital marketing, and networking, aren’t limited to jobs in IT.
    - Soft skills, like verbal communication, listening, and relationship building, are needed in digital occupations.
    - Visual communication has become increasingly important even outside of traditional data occupations. Experience with tools such as Tableau, MS Power BI, and Adobe Analytics is in high demand.
    - Social media skills, such as experience with Facebook, LinkedIn, and Adobe Photoshop, are in demand in the current media climate.
- JG: This is one of the reasons I chose not to go into software/data - within 5 years, your knowledge is outdated.

- It’s made by fermenting roots, pits, and seeds, about half of which are upcycled, or waste products. “We use grape seeds, date seeds, chicory, carob, lentils, and millet malt,” Saenz says. “Each one of these ingredients has a specific role, whether it’s to help with the mouth feel, the acidity, or the sweetness. We then grab some of those ingredients and put them through our proprietary fermentation process that allows us to develop some of the complexity around flavor and get some of the brightness and acidity notes that we’re looking for. And then we brew it with a process as close as possible to traditional coffee.”
- Caffeine, coffee’s irreplaceable stimulant, is added as an ingredient in both Minus and Atomo, in amounts comparable to traditional cold brews or energy drinks.
- Minus is meant to taste like a mocha java blend, with a medium roast, some chocolate and almond notes, and no acidity.

## [Modern Wisdom] #599 - Adam Lane Smith - 15 Harsh Psychology Truths

- Relationships
    - Couples usually go to therapy when it’s too late. Normally, women try changing for years, but the man doesn’t realise, so the situation doesn’t improve, and the woman gives up. When men do finally realise there is a problem and change is needed, they do try to change, but it’s too late - the woman is beyond the threshold. This is why most women initiate divorces.
- ADHD and mental conditions
    - Not everything is a pathology. Don't make excuses. Don't drug yourself up. Sometimes you just had to take responsibility.
    - In the literature, diagnoses can be undone when it’s no longer an issue. Modern medicine never does this - once you have e.g. ADHD, you have it for life.
    - Those with ADHD are often good entrepreneurs, but the school systems punish them for it.
- Therapy
    - Most modern therapy is focussed on female solutions - feeling heard and loved - not male ones - actionable solutions to lack of purpose - hence why most men don’t like therapy, but women do.

*JG: I stopped listening about half way through as it got too too focussed on incel culture - which, in my opinion, mostly exists on the internet. Chris’s podcasts seem to spend a lot of time on this topic.*

## The Female Brain / The Male Brain by Louann Brizendine

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D9qd7Vy2JE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D9qd7Vy2JE)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZjF9EW81p4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZjF9EW81p4)

- Fascinating explanations of why and how men and women are different, how different hormones during development result in different attitudes towards risk and emotional abilities.
- “In the adult and mated male brain testosterone has dampened their neural development around verbal communication and emotional memory, but their problem-solving circuits stay large and well connected. This can lead to the perception that male brains feel emotions less than female brains, but this isn't true. When a bonded male brain realises his partner's upset for instance, it immediately kicks into problem-solving mode. In male-female couples this difference in instinctual responses fuels many conflicts. While a female brain partner might crave communication and connection around her issue, their male brain counterparts aren't built for that. Their neural networks are hardwired to respond by offering solutions. it's well intentioned sure, but baffling to a partner who doesn't understand why they can't just listen.”

- The benefit of this particular setup is that the feces and waste produced by salmon will be available to the kelp, with the resulting uptake in nutrients helping the seaweed to grow in a faster and healthier manner. Not only will the kelp be available for use to enhance the nutrients of livestock feed for cattle, but some of its byproducts can actually be of use in salmon feed, making for a mutually beneficial arrangement.

## In pursuit of lunar oxygen, firm discovers recipe for net-zero steel

[https://interestingengineering.com/science/lunar-oxygen-recipe-carbon-free-steel](https://interestingengineering.com/science/lunar-oxygen-recipe-carbon-free-steel)

- Producing iron, naturally present in the Earth as iron oxides, is the first step in manufacturing steel. Conventionally, coal and iron oxides are combined in scorching blast furnaces to bond oxygen molecules with carbon molecules. During this process, the bioproduct is carbon dioxide (CO2), which we all know to be a significant greenhouse gas.
- Helios has found that sodium, used to manufacture table salt, may be utilized in place of carbon-rich coal. They assert that sodium oxide is created when sodium molecules interact with the oxygen molecules in iron ore. The oxygen is then released into the atmosphere after being split again into sodium and oxygen. After that, the sodium can be reused.

- More than 50 billion tonnes of rock are crushed every year worldwide in sectors for use in the construction, mining, and infrastructure industries, which currently account for around 11 per cent of global carbon emissions.
- Using CO2 gas to crush rocks to make aggregate materials, which it explains holds the potential to trap some of the carbon dioxide within the rocks through the process.
- "If the technology was adopted worldwide in aggregate production, it could potentially capture 0.5 per cent of global CO2 emissions - 175 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually,"

## Foxconn Wants To Manufacture Half Of All Electric Cars

- Foxconn is counting on its Mobility in Harmony EV platform, which it calls its “Android system for EVs.” The thinking is that if it is able to standardize the primary systems needed to manufacture electric automobiles, it will be able to quickly and cheaply adapt them to build a wide range of models for a variety of customers. This is similar to the plan hatched by Canoo to make “skateboards” that contain all the components necessary for an electric vehicle and then plunk a completed body — which Canoo calls a “top hat” — on top of of it.
- “We want to create that kind of ecosystem so anyone — for example, like United Airlines — can say, ‘I want to make a car,’”
- Initially, it is targeting five percent of the global EV market and the equivalent of $33 billion in revenue from manufacturing EVs and components by 2025. It’s longer term goal is to make nearly half the world’s EVs. Five percent of the market, assuming an EV adoption rate of 20% by 2025, would be about 900,000 vehicles.

- “They know that Silicon Valley investors won’t invest in a farm, but they’ll invest in a tech company. These companies overspend on R&D by crazy amounts, and then say, ‘Oh, shit, that didn’t work.'”
- Its farm proved that automation could run its operations. But it also had to pay the high salaries of a team of robotics and software engineers.
- Even a small, 10,000-square-foot farm might have a lighting bill over $100,000 or even $200,000 a year.
- “Is it worth spending $20 million on a cutting-edge system when you’re producing objects that might get $1 or $2 in the marketplace? That’s the problem,”

- Staff were warned that "people who become pregnant" was preferable to "expectant mothers", while "parent" is better than "mother" or "father".
- "However, we recognise that the dominance of English is one of the key issues that must be addressed in order to decolonise our ways of working and shift power.”
- Meanwhile even the word "people" should be used cautious, as it "is often misunderstood as only referring to men".

## These Researchers Have Created A New Kind Of Paint Without Any Pigments

- Conventional paints contain pigments that rely on the light absorption properties of molecules to determine their colors. The light that is not absorbed is reflected back and seen by the observer, creating the object’s color. In contrast, the plasmonic paint created by Chanda’s team relies on both light absorption and reflection to create a full-color palette. The paint’s nanostructures scatter and reflect light in such a way that it creates a vibrant range of colors.
- Plasmonic paint reflects a significant amount of sunlight and reduces the amount of heat absorbed by the building’s surface.

- The price of solar, onshore wind, and offshore wind have fallen by 62%, 55%, and 75% in under a decade. The main obstacles to generating more energy from wind and solar now are a broken planning system and archaic regulation for grid connections. It is not inevitable that it should take 12 years to build a new wind farm, 4 years to build a new solar farm, or 8 years to build a new transmission line to take energy to where it is most needed.

## The road to autonomous driving is winding

[https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/themes/the-road-to-autonomous-driving-is-winding](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/themes/the-road-to-autonomous-driving-is-winding)

- JG: A number of articles on the future of mobility covering areas including regulation, technologies (including autonomy and robo-vehicles), customers, profit models, barriers (charging, geopolitics, supply shortages, etc). I’m a big fan of minimobility (1~2 seaters):

## What is a 15-minute city and why is the idea so controversial?

[https://www.itv.com/news/2023-02-20/what-is-a-15-minute-city-and-why-is-the-idea-so-controversial](https://www.itv.com/news/2023-02-20/what-is-a-15-minute-city-and-why-is-the-idea-so-controversial)

- JG: Great idea, but people are stupid, and some politicians are taking advantage of it.
- The idea is that everything a person needs should be within a 15-minute walk or cycle from any point in the city. This includes work, shopping, education, healthcare, leisure and any other amenities a person may need in their regular life.
- Several of the proposed policies for Oxford fuelled conspiracy theories that the government wanted to confine people to their neighbourhoods. Nick Fletcher MP: "These will take away your personal freedoms.” Mark Dolan: "A surveillance culture that would make Pyongyang envious." Nigel Farage tweeted an article by the Daily Mail which described plans by Canterbury Council to stop cars travelling between neighbourhoods saying "the climate change lockdowns are coming."

## ‘Human composting,’ already legal in 6 states, could help the planet: ‘Young people are going to teach us to die better’

[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/16/what-is-human-composting-eco-friendly-alternative-to-burial-cremation.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/16/what-is-human-composting-eco-friendly-alternative-to-burial-cremation.html)

- JG: It’s funny how the most obvious, natural idea is “new”. The only reason we’ve ever buried bodies in a preserved state (i.e. full of toxic chemicals) is religion. Once I’m dead just throw me in a hole. Or a burning ship burial.

## Seaweed Is Having Its Moment in the Sun

[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/15/climate/seaweed-plastic-climate-change.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/15/climate/seaweed-plastic-climate-change.html)

- In London, a start-up is making a plastic substitute out of seaweed. In Australia and Hawaii, others are racing to grow seaweed that, when fed to livestock, can cut methane from cow burps. Researchers are studying just how much carbon dioxide can be sequestered by seaweed farms, as investors eye them as a new source of carbon credits for polluters to offset their greenhouse gas emissions.
- In Korea, bordered by water on three sides, 20 different species of seaweed have been recorded. It is central to cuisine and culture.
- Since 1968, the waters where Mr. Shin farms have warmed by 1.4 degrees Celsius, slightly higher than the global average. That’s why South Korean scientists are racing to breed strains that can thrive in warmer waters.

## All UK honey tested in EU fraud investigation fails authenticity test

[https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/26/uk-honey-fails-authenticity-test](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/26/uk-honey-fails-authenticity-test)

- Adulteration of honey with cheap sugar syrup has been exposed in a new investigation by the European Commission, which found 46% of sampled products were suspected to be fraudulent. Ten honey samples from the UK all failed the tests. They may have been blended or packaged in Britain, but the honey probably originated overseas.

## Corporate Nonsense Continues To Harm Productivity And Corporate Culture

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/danpontefract/2023/03/25/corporate-nonsense-continues-to-harm-productivity-and-corporate-culture/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danpontefract/2023/03/25/corporate-nonsense-continues-to-harm-productivity-and-corporate-culture/)

- Martin worked with a financial institution where, on average, employees received 800 emails every day. “If you do the math and you spend just one minute per email, that’s your entire workday, and you haven’t even done your work yet,” he explained.
    - A month-long trial revealed that simply banning the CC button cut the total number of emails received by everyone in half.
- It could be removing the time-consuming but low-reward tasks like everyone’s favorite, “The meeting that was booked in order to prepare for the other meeting that will discuss what will happen in the real meeting.”
- The younger generations […] will never be engaged in their work if they continue to be stuck on the hamster wheel of responding to emails and getting dragged into meetings without any usefulness.

## Stepping up: Becoming a high-potential CEO candidate

[https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/stepping-up-becoming-a-high-potential-ceo-candidate](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/stepping-up-becoming-a-high-potential-ceo-candidate)

- Stanford University economics professor Nicholas Bloom, who’s spent his career researching CEOs, describes the reality he’s observed: “It’s frankly a horrible job. I wouldn’t want it. Being a CEO of a big company is a hundred-hour-a-week job. It consumes your life. It consumes your weekend. It’s super stressful. Sure, there’re enormous perks, but it’s also all encompassing.”
- Don’t miss a step on the dance floor—deliver on your day job.
    - “Do the job you’re doing today like you’re going to do it for the rest of your life,”
- Climb onto a higher balcony to hone your view of the future, the company, and the company’s stakeholders.
    - “You have to have an absolutely first-class view of where the world is going.”
    - “I’ve seen too many candidates two years out make the mistake of moving to roles they don’t have time to succeed in,”
    - They need to have their pulse on employee, customer, and board sentiments and use them to help shape their company’s principles as issues emerge.
- Be bold, whether on the balcony or the dance floor.
- Objectively assess your capabilities versus what’s needed.
    - The first is your breadth of experience and record (for example, leading transformational change, delivering a profit-and-loss statement, and representing the company externally).
    - Second is your knowledge and expertise (for example, financial acumen, sales leadership, technology, target markets, and industry trends).
    - The third is your leadership skill (for example, strategic thinking, executive presence, team building, and self-awareness).
    - Finally, how strong are your relationships, and what is your reputation? How are you viewed by internal stakeholders, such as your boss, peers, direct reports, and influencers? How about by external stakeholders, such as investors, customers, suppliers, regulators, and community leaders? And how about by board members?
- Fill your skill gaps and gauge your progress on the way.
- Refuse to play politics in the process.
    - You’ll want to increase your visibility to ensure that those who need to know are aware that you want to make the final ascent without being seen as self-promoting or currying favor.
- You’ll be able to articulate why you want the role. You’ll have a bold vision for where the company should go next and how value will be created across the portfolio. You’ll also have translated that into a perspective on what the company needs from its next CEO and be able to make a fact-based argument that your experience, knowledge, leadership skills, and relationships make you the right horse for the course. You’ll be prepared to talk about how you’ve grown over the past three to five years yet also be clear-eyed and honest about your areas of weakness and how you’ll need to surround yourself with others who can help in those areas. You’ll also have built a following among your colleagues by leading authentically and helping others.

## The age of average

[https://www.alexmurrell.co.uk/articles/the-age-of-average](https://www.alexmurrell.co.uk/articles/the-age-of-average)

- JG: The basic premise of the article is “fashions and trends exist, and in the globalised world, they exist worldwide”. But the summary message is nice:
- This is your call to arms. Whether you’re in film or fashion, media or marketing, architecture, automotive or advertising, it doesn’t matter. Our visual culture is flatlining and the only cure is creativity. It’s time to cast aside conformity. It’s time to exorcise the expected. It’s time to decline the indistinguishable. Or as the ad agency BBH says: When the world zigs. Zag.

## Essentialism - Greg McKeown (Blinkist)

- Only do the few essential things. Do less, but better. Have a single big goal.
- Give yourself time to be bored.
- Give yourself time to play, for creativity.
- Be minimalistic. Journal only essential events, not everything. Focus. Remove things that waste your time.
- Ignore sunk costs.
- Routines help.

## [The James Altucher Show] Mastering the Magic of Language: Insights on Persuasion and Connection

- Explicitly use the word "you" for social (”it's good for you”) but not help/support (comes across as blame/accusation)
- Identity: “be a helper” > “please help”
- Choice: “should” vs “could”

## Edward Dando

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Dando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Dando)

- Edward Dando (c.1803 – 28 August 1832) was a thief who came to public notice in Britain because of his unusual habit of overeating at food stalls and inns, and then revealing that he had no money to pay. Although the fare he consumed was varied, he was particularly fond of oysters, once having eaten 25 dozen (300) of them with a loaf and a half of bread with butter.

## 100 Tips for a Better Life

[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7hFeMWC6Y5eaSixbD/100-tips-for-a-better-life](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7hFeMWC6Y5eaSixbD/100-tips-for-a-better-life)

- JG: Many are generic or obvious (or simply don’t apply to me), but some I like:
- You can improve your communication skills with practice much more effectively than you can improve your intelligence with practice. If you’re not that smart but can communicate ideas clearly, you have a great advantage over everybody who can’t communicate clearly.
- You do not live in a video game. There are no pop-up warnings if you’re about to do something foolish, or if you’ve been going in the wrong direction for too long. You have to create your own warnings.
- If you listen to successful people talk about their methods, remember that all the people who used the same methods and failed did not make videos about it.
- When dating, de-emphasizing your quirks will lead to 90% of people thinking you’re kind of alright. Emphasizing your quirks will lead to 10% of people thinking you’re fascinating and fun. Those are the people interested in dating you. Aim for them.

## Quotes

> Success is an asynchronous and asymmetric outcome. It's asynchronous because input/effort and outcome do not follow a linear timeline. You might struggle for years, only to succeed in a last random act. And it's asymmetric, meaning there is no linear connection between the effort you put in and the success you get out.
> 

Gennaro Cuofano, FourWeekMBA

> I do regret the passing of what I regard as one of the great luxuries of civilisation, and that is solitude. I think those snatched moments, the 20 minutes when you’re waiting at the luggage carousel, you used to have to do nothing but go into your thoughts. Now we all take out our phone, we’ve been deprived of the signal for a couple of hours on an airplane, and maybe we don’t have quite as rich an inner life. If you get in the habit of solitude - which is an entirely different thing, by the way, to loneliness - treat your mind as a garden that you can walk around in, and I think generally leads to more happiness.

## Research estimates EV drivers could earn billions of pounds selling power back to the grid

[https://www.businessgreen.com/news/4088249/‘-potential-enormous-research-estimates-ev-drivers-earn-billions-pounds-selling-power-grid](https://www.businessgreen.com/news/4088249/%E2%80%98-potential-enormous-research-estimates-ev-drivers-earn-billions-pounds-selling-power-grid)

- Electric cars could replace 20 gas power stations during peak winter electricity demand.
- ECIU said the potential of V2G technology in helping to balance the grid would rely on high adoption of battery-powered vehicles - potentially as many as 13.5 million on UK roads by 2030.
- [V2G] could enable drivers to sell enough power back to the grid to collectively generate EV owners almost £7.6bn by 2035.

- Laminated wood is stronger than steel proportionate to its weight making for lighter more practical towers.

## This new technique could cut cement GHG emissions by 30%

[https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/eco-efficient-cement-gamechanger](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/eco-efficient-cement-gamechanger)

- The study showed that replacing 30 percent of the cement in concrete with clean coal fly ash made it 51 percent more robust and 28% more flexible. Moreover, it reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent and heavy metal emissions by 41 percent.
- The process involves mixing fly ash with carbon black, which makes the mixture conductive, placing it between two electrodes, and supplying a short current pulse. This raises the temperature to about 5,432 °F (3,000 °C), which makes the heavy metals evaporate and be caught. The removal efficiency for various heavy metals ranges between 70 percent and 90 percent in just one second.

## Battery & Solar Recycling Marches On In March

[https://cleantechnica.com/2023/03/27/battery-solar-recycling-marches-on-in-march/](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/03/27/battery-solar-recycling-marches-on-in-march/)

- Black mass is the industry term used for the material that remains after expired lithium-ion batteries are shredded and all casing removed. It contains valuable elements such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, copper, and graphite that can be recycled in order to produce new lithium-ion batteries.
- According to data from McKinsey & Company, available battery material for recycling is projected to increase by 20% each year up until 2040, so there will be plenty of materials to process.
- Electra Battery Materials Corporation is ahead of the curve with its demonstration plant that has successfully extracted lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, copper, and graphite from black mass in batch mode.

## Lithium recycling: Researchers find a pocket and eco-friendly way

[https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/inexpensive-eco-friendly-lithium-recycling](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/inexpensive-eco-friendly-lithium-recycling)

- The battery first needs to be ground where the material reacts with aluminum to form metallic composites. Lithium, which is water soluble, is recovered by mixing water with the ground mixture and then heating it separately to make the water evaporate.
- The researchers found that up to 70 percent lithium recovery can be achieved with this method, which does not require the use of corrosive chemicals or high temperatures.

## The New Light Is Bad

[https://nymag.com/strategist/article/led-light-bulbs-investigation.html](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/led-light-bulbs-investigation.html)

- Where an old-fashioned tungsten filament can generally be trusted to be either intact or broken, the drivers and diodes inside the new bulbs are subject to the kinds of glitches and compatibility errors you get from other electronics, especially once dimmers get involved. They can crash or hang, or audibly buzz from electromagnetic interference, or go haywire from being fed the wrong kind of power signal. LEDs, in other words, can be broken even when they appear to be working. “It’s still *on.* You still have light coming out,” Nelson said. “They don’t just fail or burn out like a halogen source does. Oftentimes, there’s light loss or there’s color shift.”
- It’s true that CRI numbers are kind of useless. All else being equal, if light on an object gets dimmer — if you start with an object outdoors, in full sunlight, then bring it indoors to that same daylight, but less of it, now coming through a window — the object will appear more gray. The way color rendering is defined, the diminished light is performing at the same level as it did outside. The color-rendering index scores it the same. But the object looks worse.
- Many [LEDs] cannot dim at all; those that are advertised as dimmable do not reduce their temperature or even reduce the intensity of the light they put out. Instead, a common method is to adjust how frequently they switch off and on, which is dozens of times per second. Extra-sensitive people can sometimes detect this flicker or find themselves with unexplained headaches and dizziness. For everyone, the light gets even duller looking than before.

## New coconut, lemon material could be used to heat and cool our homes

[https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/coconut-lemon-material-heat-and-cool-homes](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/coconut-lemon-material-heat-and-cool-homes)

- The process begins with removing lignin from wood, which opens pores in the wood as well as strips the color—resulting in transparent wood. The wood gaps are then filled with citrus (limonene acrylate) and coconut-based molecules.
- When the sun shines, the wood becomes transparent and stores more energy, while at night it becomes cloudy and releases the heat stored during the day.

## New rainbow films offer eco-friendly option for AC units, can cool your house and car

## Pulsing sound waves can help remove microplastics from ocean, study reveals

[https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/sound-waves-microplastics-ocean-study](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/sound-waves-microplastics-ocean-study)

- The team has created a prototype made of eight mm steel tubes and a transducer (a device that converts one form of energy into another). When the transducer was activated, it sent pulsating sound waves through the metal tube. As a result, the particles moved and vibrated, allowing small pieces of plastic to accumulate in flowing water as they passed through the system. For instance, consider a loudspeaker that vibrates the ground, thereby bouncing dust particles toward each other.
- The device was able to remove over 70 percent of the small plastics and 82 percent of the larger-size microplastics.
- The device would cost approximately seven cents to operate for an hour and a half to clean one liter of water.

## [The Big Green Money Show] Medicines and Healthcare, with GSK

- Billions of single-use gloves are used by the NHS and in most cases they're not needed (the majority are not sterile). They’re mostly used for signalling hygiene, when washing hands is more effective.
- It can be cheaper to buy reusable and sterilise between uses, but the habit has become to buy single-use and dispose - especially operating gowns.
- Inhalers for asthma are 40% of GSK emissions - but alternatives are coming/available.
- Mangroves are amazing.

- As the Kia Soul pulled up next to the Silverado, everything seemed normal until the truck’s driver side front wheel suddenly spun itself off and rolled in front of the Kia. The Kia ran over the upright wheel at highway speed, causing it to roll onto the tire and launch into the air. The vehicle soared to almost double the height of the Silverado before crashing back down on its roof.
- While it’s unclear what caused the wheel to fall off the Silverado, it’s possible that it was due to a wheel spacer or lug nut failure.
- Despite the dramatic nature of the crash, the driver of the Kia Soul was able to walk away unharmed.

## Newly discovered 'einstein' tile is a 13-sided shape that solves a decades-old math problem

- JG: Data from 2018. Very interesting. Most companies are “Professional, scientific and technical”, but highest revenue is from “Finance and insurance”. “Finance and insurance” also dominates revenue per company, but is followed by “Mining, quarrying and utilities” and “Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply” - they have very low counts but high revenue per company. However, for small companies, “Finance and insurance” has much lower per-company revenue. “Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles” is consistently pretty good.

- Increasing levels of CO2 in the Earth’s atmosphere will result in a long-term decline in air density at high altitudes, according to new research from British Antarctic Survey. Such decreased density will reduce drag on objects orbiting in the upper atmosphere, between 90 and 500 km altitude, extending the lifetime of space debris and elevating the risk of collisions between debris and satellites.

[https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/a-new-microwave-technology-can-ease-solar-cell-recycling](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/a-new-microwave-technology-can-ease-solar-cell-recycling)

- The silicon found in solar panels goes through annealing in a furnace with a temperature ranging between 900 and 1100 °C.
- The researchers explain that microwave radiation selectively heats silicon and leaves the laminated panel of glass, aluminum, and plastic largely unaffected.
- Under treatment, the plastic coating, which protects the silicon plate from contamination and moisture, gets softened and hence can be peeled off mechanically. The scale can be then easily delaminated, and its components can be reused without harsh chemicals.

- If the wound becomes infected, the color of the dressing will change. This color change property is determined by the wound's pH. Normal wounds (non-infected) have a pH of about 5.5, but when an infection develops, the pH rises to 8, or even higher.

## Where We Are in the Big Cycle: On the Brink of a Period of Great Disorder

- Each force, and most importantly, the combination of them, is now occurring at the largest magnitude since the 1930-45 period and at levels of magnitude similar to those that existed just before prior breakdowns and seismic shifts in domestic and world orders.
1. Enormous amounts of debt
2. Big conflicts within countries (now most importantly the US)
3. Big conflicts between countries arising from the rise of countries (now most importantly China)
4. Acts of nature—i.e., climate change.
5. Technology changes—e.g. AI.
- Because populists are so committed to winning at all costs and are unwilling to compromise, more-intense-than-expected battles are more likely. Each one of these forces is a part of the system. For example, the debt ceiling increase will not go as smoothly as most people expect and will likely become a big election issue that will split the country because both sides will fight for victories and will be less willing to compromise. Also, in this election year, aggressiveness with China will intensify because most everyone is anti-China, so those running will want to outdo each other with their China-bashing. Continuing engagement between US and Taiwanese leaders will likely still happen, which, together with the Gallagher House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party hearings, will push the US-China conflict closer to the brink (or over the brink).

## How NASA Reinvented The Wheel

[https://youtu.be/vSNtifE0Z2Q](https://youtu.be/vSNtifE0Z2Q)

- JG: Super cool. A metal with memory: set a shape when it’s hot, deform it when it’s cold, but when it’s re-heated, it returns to its original shape. It’s also super stretchy.
- [Summarize.tech](http://Summarize.tech) summary: NASA has developed a metal alloy that can stretch up to 30 times its original size without deforming and can spring back to its initial size with no damage, allowing the creation of airless tires suitable for low-pressure conditions on other planets. Nitinol, the nickel and titanium alloy, has great elasticity, can endure more stress than steel and maintains its shape when heated, making it an excellent material for making wheels. Nitinol tires can stretch up to 8% of its length without causing permanent damage, and the unique properties of nitinol make it useful for creating complete suspension systems without adding weight. Nitinol is also used in medical stents and actuators that generate significant force. Furthermore, Henson Shaving produced a lifetime razor that is modeled after aerospace technology.

## Shell admits 1.5C climate goal means immediate end to fossil fuel growth

- Shell had previously claimed that oil and gas production could rise for another decade, even as warming was limited to 1.5C.
- If the world followed Shell’s pathway, it would “overshoot” the 1.5C limit for decades, before returning below that level by using largely unproven, energy-intensive machines to suck large volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere towards the end of the century.

## Airlines want you to buy carbon offsets. Experts say they’re a ‘scam.’

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/04/17/carbon-offsets-flights-airlines/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/04/17/carbon-offsets-flights-airlines/)

- “Unlike how they’re presented to travelers, offsets are not really quantified, verified tons of emissions reductions,” Instead, they’re programs that might do some environmental good but ultimately lead to “hard-to-estimate emissions reductions.” Haya said, “In today’s offset market, those reductions are dramatically overestimated.”
- The most common type of offsets purchased by the aviation industry are forestry and nature-based offsets, which numerous studies have found are mostly worthless. In January, an investigation by the Guardian into the biggest certifier of rainforest carbon offsets found that more than 90 percent didn’t represent any carbon reductions.

## Glass or plastic: which is better for the environment?

[https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230427-glass-or-plastic-which-is-better-for-the-environment](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230427-glass-or-plastic-which-is-better-for-the-environment)

- Glass bottles have a higher environmental footprint than plastic and other bottled container materials including drinks cartons and aluminum cans.
    - Deforestation/biodiversity loss due to mining; health impacts for miners; sand shortages; processing temperatures.
- A key problem with glass recycling is that it does not eradicate the remelting process, which is the most energy intensive part of glass production. It accounts for 75% of the energy consumption during production. Even though glass containers can be reused an average of 12-20 times, glass is often treated as single-use. Single-use glass disposed of at landfills can take up to one million years to decompose. Glass recycling rates vary significantly across the globe. The EU and the UK have an average recycling rate of 74% and 76%, while the US figure was 31.3% in 2018.
    - So reuse instead of recycle.

- The United States and China are on the brink of war and are beyond the ability to talk.
- There is a general belief that the Americans are more strongly pushing their values and approaches (e.g., democracy, capitalism, and to some extent Christianity) than the Chinese are pushing theirs. It is often said by leaders in other countries that the Americans are trying to control them and draw them into war in a more heavy-handed way than the Chinese are doing. The Chinese point out that this way of dealing with other countries is consistent with their thousands of years old tradition of following a tribute system type of international relations (i.e., a symbiotic relationship between a stronger and a weaker power that benefits both and doesn’t seek to ideologically or politically control the lesser power). They find this more practical than what one leader called a “Mediterranean-based control approach” that is typical in the Western countries.

## Why the Brain’s Connections to the Body Are Crisscrossed

[https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-the-brains-connections-to-the-body-are-crisscrossed-20230419/](https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-the-brains-connections-to-the-body-are-crisscrossed-20230419/)

- Neural cross wiring is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom — even the neural connections in lowly nematode worms are wired with left-right reversal across the animal’s midline.
- Mapping 3D space onto a 2D plane in the brain seems to explain why our nervous system is cross-wired: Counterintuitive as it may seem, directing nerve fibers across the midline is the topologically simplest way to avoid errors.
- Since left and right depend on a frame of reference, people frequently confuse the letters “d” and “b,” and “p” and “q,” but they rarely confuse “q” and “d.” In the first two cases, the identical shapes are flipped along the vertical axis (swapping left and right), and in the second, they are flipped along the horizontal axis (swapping up and down). As bilaterally symmetrical creatures we never mistake up and down, because those directions are always the same, regardless of viewpoint, but left and right are relative to an object.

## Yet Another Problem With Recycling: It Spews Microplastics

[https://www.wired.com/story/yet-another-problem-with-recycling-it-spews-microplastics/](https://www.wired.com/story/yet-another-problem-with-recycling-it-spews-microplastics/)

- Even with filtering, they calculate that the total discharge from the different washes could produce up to 75 billion particles per cubic meter of wastewater. Depending on the recycling facility, that liquid would ultimately get flushed into city water systems or the environment.
- The good news here is that filtration makes a difference: Without it, the researchers calculated that this single recycling facility could emit up to 6.5 million pounds of microplastic per year. Filtration got it down to an estimated 3 million pounds. “So it definitely was making a big impact when they installed the filtration,” says Brown. “We found particularly high removal efficiency of particles over 40 microns.”

## Newly discovered Arctic microbes may make recycling plastics carbon-neutral

[https://interestingengineering.com/science/arctic-microbes-may-make-recycling-plastics-carbon-neutral](https://interestingengineering.com/science/arctic-microbes-may-make-recycling-plastics-carbon-neutral)

- Currently available models only work at temperatures above 30°C, requiring a heating process that is not carbon-neutral.
- “Here we show that novel microbial taxa obtained from the ‘plastisphere’ of alpine and arctic soils were able to break down biodegradable plastics at 15°C,”

## Captura facility could remove gigatons of carbon dioxide from the ocean

[https://newatlas.com/technology/captura-carbon-dioxide-ocean/](https://newatlas.com/technology/captura-carbon-dioxide-ocean/)

- The process begins by bringing a filtered stream of ocean water into the facility, where the electrodialysis technology is used to create acid. This acid is then added to the ocean water, triggering a chemical reaction that extracts CO2 from the water. The process is accelerated using a gas-liquid contactor and vacuum pump, resulting in a purified stream of carbon dioxide that can be reused or sequestered.

- The video itself was average, but the comment from Kim Jong-un (yes really) was fascinating:

> We used to have our own time zone called Pyongyang Standard Time (UTC+08:30). Everyone likes to think we started that thing in 2015 and ended it in 2018 to return to UTC+09:00 as a step in unifying the peninsula, but the history behind it is much older!
> 
> Before modern clocks were introduced into Korea, Koreans kept time with the help of a sundial during the daytime and a water clock at night. In 1434, Jang Yeong-sil, a Joseon scientist and astronomer with other scientists, developed Korea's first sundial, Angbu Ilgu and was put into service as standard time-keeper of the kingdom and began the standard time at Hanyang (Seoul) which was calculated to be UTC+08:27:52.  The Korean Empire adopted a standard time of 8½ hours ahead of UTC around the beginning of the 20th century. This changed in 1912 to UTC+09:00 during Japanese control so Korea could align with Japan Standard Time.

- Wiki: Crony capitalism, sometimes called cronyism, is an economic system in which businesses thrive not as a result of free enterprise, but rather as a return on money amassed through collusion between a business class and the political class.
- This year the publication details 2,640 billionaires worth $12trn or 12% of gdp. Most of those listed do not operate in rent-seeking (an economic rent is the surplus remaining once capital and labour have been paid which, with perfect competition, tends towards zero) sectors.

## UCLA Says We Can Hack The Ocean To Store Carbon Dioxide

[https://cleantechnica.com/2023/05/15/ucla-says-we-can-hack-the-ocean-to-store-carbon-dioxide/](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/05/15/ucla-says-we-can-hack-the-ocean-to-store-carbon-dioxide/)

![Untitled](/images/old/week20.webp)

- The seawater would flow through a mesh that allows an electrical charge to pass into the water, rendering it alkaline. This kicks off a set of chemical reactions that ultimately combine dissolved carbon dioxide with calcium and magnesium native to seawater, producing limestone and magnesite by a process similar to how seashells form. The seawater that flows out would then be depleted of dissolved carbon dioxide and ready to take up more. A co-product of the reaction, besides minerals, is hydrogen, which is a clean fuel.

## What Drives This Madness On Hydrogen?

[https://cleantechnica.com/2023/05/16/what-drives-this-madness-on-hydrogen/](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/05/16/what-drives-this-madness-on-hydrogen/)

- Oil and gas firms. They have two motivations. Delaying the transition is one of them, of course. But if they can’t convince everyone that hydrogen is required for energy, they won’t be able to turn their hydrocarbon reservoirs into money via blue hydrogen, and they will be worthless. As firms like Shell and bp have 4–10 billion barrels of proven reserves, those assets will become almost worthless. And these firms treat these reserves as a fiscal tool for debt financing. Worthless reserves = financial institutions calling in their debts, the collapse of their stock prices, and the bankruptcy of those firms.

## The Freaky Chemistry of Landfills

[https://gizmodo.com/how-do-landfills-work-chemistry-trash-pollution-1849703063](https://gizmodo.com/how-do-landfills-work-chemistry-trash-pollution-1849703063)

- Leachate, or the water that infiltrated a landfill and then leached chemicals and pollutants from the decomposing garbage. The chemicals that got into leachate can include heavy metals from electronic waste, bits of plastic that are breaking down, and decomposed organic matter. The trouble is that, even though landfills are engineered to collect as much leachate as possible, some is bound to escape, permeating through soil and aquifers into drinking water and natural water reservoirs.
- The EPA estimates that 14.5% of methane emissions in 2020 were from landfills, making them the third largest emitter of the gas.
    - If we can harness the methane that’s emitted from a landfill, Cadillo-Quiroz says, it could  be used to power generators, meaning that this waste gas could be repurposed into a source of energy—but only if we design landfills more intentionally and with better management systems.

- “Oh, it's not a big deal, it's just one little thing, not worth having a big argument about it. I'll just give in.” Well, that seems generous, but it's a really bad idea. You have to ask yourself, "Are you really, completely, 100% over this? You're giving in? No animosity? You're not secretly hoping that maybe they'll do something for you in return or a little behavior change here or there?” Because if there's anything at all when you're giving in that you can feel bad about later, you're nuking the relationship - you're creating scar tissue with yourself.

## How bankruptcy helps the coal industry avoid environmental liability

[https://grist.org/accountability/how-bankruptcy-helps-the-coal-industry-avoid-environmental-liability/](https://grist.org/accountability/how-bankruptcy-helps-the-coal-industry-avoid-environmental-liability/)

- The purpose of bankruptcy is to give desperate people and companies time and relief from creditors so they can get back on their feet. But not all creditors are treated equally. Bankruptcy law gives secured creditors such as banks, law firms, the Internal Revenue Service and equipment suppliers — but not environmental costs or fines — priority for payment.
- Knowing that they won’t end up on the hook for reclamation, other coal companies buy mines out of bankruptcy — and then often go bankrupt themselves. The ProPublica analysis identified 2,030 mines in Kentucky and West Virginia that have been through bankruptcy since 2012 — more than a third of all coal mines in those states. Of the bankrupt mines, 491, or 24 percent, have gone through more than one bankruptcy.

## How a floating hydrogen farm has moved China closer to clean renewable energy

- Hydrogen from seawater without desalination.
- After 10 days of operating in seawater, the scientists said the system still maintained an impressive ion rejection rate of more than 99.99 per cent, producing hydrogen that was at least 99.9 pure.
- The technology costs as little as 11.2 yuan (US$1.57) per kilogram (2.2 pounds) of hydrogen – much less than the current mainstream cost of hydrogen production from natural gas, which ranges from 20 to 24 yuan per kilogram.

## Hydrogen Can Make Global Heating Worse, CICERO Study Shows

[https://cleantechnica.com/2023/06/11/hydrogen-can-make-global-heating-worse-cicero-study-shows/](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/06/11/hydrogen-can-make-global-heating-worse-cicero-study-shows/)

- Hydrogen is not a greenhouse gas, but its chemical reactions in the atmosphere affect greenhouse gases like methane, ozone, and stratospheric water vapor. Therefore, emissions of hydrogen can lead to increased global warming despite its lack of direct radiative properties.
- Four main climate impacts are associated with increased hydrogen levels: (1) a longer methane lifetime and hence increased methane abundances, (2) an enhanced production of tropospheric ozone and changes in stratospheric ozone, (3) an increased stratospheric water vapor production, and (4) changes in the production of certain aerosols. The most important reaction driving these impacts is the destruction of hydrogen by OH: H2+OH→H2O+H

- The team engineered concrete coated with titanium dioxide which produces molecules called reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of sunlight. These are unstable molecules with one or more unpaired electrons, making them highly reactive and capable of breaking down air pollutants, especially volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and ammonia, rendering them harmless.
- The team observed levels of nitrogen oxides to drop by 18% over 24 hours. Salts formed in the concrete as a result of the reactions were washed away by rain.

## Superbugs will struggle to evolve resistance to unusual new antibiotic

[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2376666-superbugs-will-struggle-to-evolve-resistance-to-unusual-new-antibiotic/](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2376666-superbugs-will-struggle-to-evolve-resistance-to-unusual-new-antibiotic/)

- The team found it kills a range of disease-causing bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, better known as the MRSA superbug, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes TB.
- Existing antibiotics typically target the protein enzymes that assemble the cell wall, and bacteria can alter the shape of these enzymes to evade attack. Clovibactin instead targets a chemical group called a pyrophosphate that is found on not just one, but three different building blocks of cell walls. So, to survive, a bacterium would have to alter all three building blocks.

## How South Korea Puts Its Food Scraps to Good Use

[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/14/world/asia/south-korea-food-waste.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/14/world/asia/south-korea-food-waste.html)

- South Korea banned food scraps from its landfills almost 20 years ago. Here, the vast majority of it gets turned into animal feed, fertilizer and fuel for heating homes.
- Debris — bones, seeds, shells — is picked out by hand. (Dobong’s plant is one of the last in the nation where this step isn’t automated.) A conveyor belt carries the waste into a grinder, which reduces it to small pieces. Anything that isn’t easily shredded, like plastic bags, is filtered out and incinerated. Then the waste is baked and dehydrated. The moisture goes into pipes leading to a water treatment plant, where some of it is used to produce biogas. The rest is purified and discharged into a nearby stream. What’s left of the waste at the processing plant is ground into the final product: a dry, brown powder that smells like dirt. It’s a feed supplement for chickens and ducks, rich in protein and fiber, and given away to any farm that wants it.

## 40 Mind-Expanding Concepts (Summer 2023)

[https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/40-mind-expanding-concepts-summer](https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/40-mind-expanding-concepts-summer)

- If a talent comes naturally to someone, they assume it’s nothing special, and instead try to improve at what seems difficult to them. Therefore, people often specialize in things they're bad at.
- Kleck (1980) told his research subjects they’d engage in a study to test discrimination. He painted scars on some of their faces, and then had them attend job interviews. The participants with scars painted on their faces reported feeling discriminated against for their looks. However, unknown to them, their scars had been removed before they entered the interviews. It would seem we can be victimized by the mere belief that we’re a victim.
- How do "kind" falsehoods like "sex is a spectrum" and "obesity is healthy" go mainstream? Activists with PhDs use academic journals & scientific jargon to disguise ideology as knowledge, which is then cited as fact by the media & Wikipedia.

## Four non-transmission solutions for clean energy with new power lines in the permitting ‘Valley of Death’

- Storage-as-transmission: Batteries strategically placed at congested nodes where load profiles of limited capacity lines allow energy to be stored when loads ease to offset later demand spikes.
- Grid-enhancing technologies: Dynamic Line Ratings, or DLR, can expand a transmission line’s carrying capacity in real time based on readings from sensors throughout the system. Advanced Power Flow Control moves electricity away from overloaded lines to streamline energy delivery. Topology Optimization uses multi-factor awareness to maximize a system’s carrying capacity.
- Economic overbuilding: “If transmission bottlenecks remain formidable, and if the costs of renewables and storage keep falling, overbuilding might be more economic than dealing with queue and permitting obstacles,”
- Engaging customers: Flattening customers’ peak demand during the 5% to 10% of system hours that cause reliability threats.

## As plastics pile up, can 'advanced' recycling cut the waste?

[https://www.greenbiz.com/article/plastics-pile-can-advanced-recycling-cut-waste](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/plastics-pile-can-advanced-recycling-cut-waste)

- Using an "advanced plastics recycling" technique called pyrolysis, post-consumer plastics delivered to the Brightmark plant are subjected to intense heat in an oxygen-starved environment until their molecules shake apart, yielding a type of oil similar to plastic’s petroleum feedstock, along with some waste byproducts.
- There’s a real lack of transparency about how much plastic they’re recycling and what their end product — pyrolysis oil — will actually be used for.
- Powell says his aim is 100 percent circularity, plastic to plastic, "and we’re going to be relentless in that pursuit." But while the market matures and prices for recycled plastic drop, he admits that as "an interim step" some pyrolysis oil could be sold as fuel (to power airplanes, trucks and other heavy transportation).

## How Many Things Must One Analyst Get Wrong In Order To Proclaim A Convenient Decarbonization Minerals Shortage?

- Michaux first commits the primary energy fallacy, multiplying the future requirement for energy by a large percentage. As I noted recently, with heat pumps, electrified ground transportation and some more efficient industrial electric heat, the USA’s primary energy demand drops by 50%, even accounting for continued inefficiencies. Fossil fuels are deeply wasteful forms of energy.
- Broadening the grid with HVDC fundamentally drops grid storage requirements by allowing electrons to flow from where they are generated to where they are needed, and from low demand areas to high demand areas. But not in Michaux’ world.
- Michaux then assumes that the only form of energy storage is lithium ion batteries brimming with cobalt and nickel.

- The system is scientifically known as Alkaline Hydrolysis, which uses pressurized water and a small amount of potassium hydroxide to break down the human body gently. The deceased is enclosed in a biodegradable pouch and placed in a container. The process of breaking down the body happens inside the vessel. It takes approximately four hours, and soft bones are left as residue at the end. These are dried and then reduced to a white powder, similar to ash. The remains are then returned to relatives in a sustainable urn. There is no smoke or emissions emitted in the mechanism.

## Why is North up?

[https://youtu.be/B14Gtm2Z_70](https://youtu.be/B14Gtm2Z_70)

- Orient(ataion) comes from the word for East
- In many old societies the most important direction (often associated with “up”/the top) was East, because it’s where the sun rises.
- Ancient Egypt (and then the Arab world in general) has the South at the top because the Nile flows South to North.
- The Chinese invented the compass and said it pointed towards South. Others traditionally used the North star, so flipped it - and European global domination cemented this.
- Grid cities often have North off-up to make the maps look better (e.g. Manhattan)..

## Gen Z Are Freezing Their Eggs. Why?

[https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvj7nz/why-gen-z-are-freezing-eggs](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvj7nz/why-gen-z-are-freezing-eggs)

- Patients are required to inject themselves with a hormonal medication of gonadotropins twice a day, with the aim of encouraging follicle growth to stimulate as many eggs as possible. This can lead to overstimulation of the ovaries, otherwise known as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which occurs in five percent of IVF and egg freezing cycles.
- The procedure also carries mental health risks as a by-product of the influx of hormones it requires.
- Prices range from £2,720 to £3,920 for an egg freezing cycle.
- A 2018 study from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in the U.K. found that the use of a patients’ own frozen eggs resulted in a live birth only 18 percent of the time per cycle.

## A few things to know before stealing my 914

- Depress the clutch as you would in any car, and pull the knob from its secure location out of first gear. Now you will become adrift in the zone known to early Porsche owners as “Neverland” and your quest will be to find second gear. Prepare yourself for a ten-second-or-so adventure. Do not go straight forward with the shift knob, as you will only find Reverse waiting there to mock you with a shriek of high-speed gear teeth machining themselves into round cylinders. Should you hear this noise, retreat immediately to the only easy spot to find in this transmission: neutral. This is a safe place, no real damage can occur here, but alas, no forward motion will happen either. From this harbor of peace, you can re-attempt to find second, but you may just want to go for any “port in a storm”, given that the traffic behind you is now cheering you on in your quest with vigorous horn-honks of support and encouragement.

## How ancient 'skywells' are keeping Chinese homes cool

[https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230712-how-ancient-skywells-are-keeping-chinese-homes-cool](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230712-how-ancient-skywells-are-keeping-chinese-homes-cool)

- A skywell, or "tian jing" (天井) in Mandarin, is a typical feature of a traditional home in southern and eastern China. Different from a northern Chinese courtyard, or "yuan zi" (院子), a skywell is smaller and less exposed to the outdoor environment.
- Studies have found that the temperatures inside some of the skywells in southern China are significantly lower than the outside – by up to 4.3C.
- When wind blows above a skywell house, it can enter the indoor space through the opening. Because outdoor air is often cooler than indoor air, the incoming breeze travels down the walls to the lower stories and create airflows by replacing warmer indoor air, which rises and leaves through the opening.
- Even when there is no natural wind, air circulation still takes place inside a skywell home due to the "chimney effect". The temperature difference between the top and bottom of the skywell means warm air inside the skywell rises, drawing cooler air from the rooms to the bottom of the skywell.
- Some skyscrapers use the ventilation principle of skywells to improve airflows without building a courtyard out of concerns of practicality. The 68-storey Dongguan TBA Tower in Guandong province, for example, brings natural airflows to every floor with internal "windpipes" that function in a similar way to skywells.

## How to do great work

[http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html)

- Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones.
- The work you choose needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that offers scope to do great work.
- The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive.
- Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them.
- The key: consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing.
- The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal, mathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and luck. Luck by definition you can't do anything about, so we can ignore that. And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want to do great work. So the problem boils down to ability and interest. Can you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will combine to yield an explosion of new ideas?
- When in doubt, optimize for interestingness.
- When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions.
- Take as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk is proportionate to reward, so don't look for certainty, but for a bet with high expected value. If you're not failing occasionally, you're probably being too conservative.
- The right strategy is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future.
- By letting your mind wander a little, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by frontal attack.
- When you let your mind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at that moment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out of the top spot, or you'll waste this valuable type of thinking on the distraction instead.
- It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working. You'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial threshold. It's ok to lie to yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example. Lots of great things began with someone saying "How hard could it be?"
- You have to be comfortable enough with the world being full of puzzles that you're willing to see them, but not so comfortable that you don't want to solve them.
- People new to a field will often copy existing work. There's nothing inherently bad about that.
- The features that are easiest to imitate are the most likely to be the flaws.
- One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from one field into another.

- Social Traps: pits caused by social dynamics
    - (4) Prison of Solidarity → you hold yourself back by “caring” for others
    - (5) Coerced Confinement → someone else holds you back through guilt, threats, etc
- Avoidance & Desire Traps: pits of fear, pain and pleasure
    - (6) Toothless Tiger → you’re afraid of failing and looking stupid
    - (7) Barbed Wire Barrier → success will require a temporary pain you don’t want to deal with
    - (8) Addiction → the negative experience has some positive side-effects that overcome your willpower to succeed

## The Pathologization Pandemic

[https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/the-pathologization-pandemic](https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/the-pathologization-pandemic)

- Women are almost twice as likely as men to report having long Covid, while transgender people are significantly more likely to do so than everyone else.
- A study of nearly two million people published in Nature found that people who reported three or more symptoms of long Covid included 4% of people with no evidence of having had Covid.
- One study found that people prone to anxiety and depression before Covid infection were 45% more likely to develop long Covid after infection, and the Nature study found that having anxiety and depression before Covid infection almost doubled the chance of reporting long Covid after infection.
- A much likelier explanation is that, since the symptoms of mood disorders overlap with those of long Covid, people are mistaking distress for the side-effects of viral infection.
- The group that’s disproportionately reporting gender dysphoria — adolescent girls — is the same demographic as the group deemed in the German study to be disproportionately at risk of long Covid.
- Increases have occurred for major depressive disorder, attention-deficit disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and various eating disorders. It seems young people and their doctors are increasingly viewing personal issues as medical disorders — we are facing a “pathologization pandemic.”
- Most people, however, are happy to have their personal failings blamed on medical issues, because it absolves them of responsibility. It’s not your fault you violently lashed out, you have trauma. It’s not your fault you lack energy, you have long Covid. It’s not your fault you hate the way you look, you have gender dysphoria.
- The number of pregnancies deemed to require caesarean sections has gradually increased because this method of delivering babies is more profitable. Likewise, if you’re simply sad then medical companies can’t monetize you, but if your distress is reclassified as, say, gender dysphoria, those companies can sell you puberty blockers or surgical procedures.
- Research shows conservatives tend to have an internal locus of control, which means they believe that their decisions, as opposed to external forces, control their destiny. Liberals, meanwhile, tend to have an external locus, which means they believe their lives are determined by forces beyond their control.
    
    ![Untitled](/images/sections/consumption-and-media/week30-2.png)
    
- The polar opposite of pathologization is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Although referred to as therapy, it’s closer to a form of mental training. Based on the Ancient Greek philosophy of Stoicism, it teaches a lesson the West has all but forgotten: that our feelings are not always valid, but often deluded and self-destructive. It trains people to overcome harmful emotions by reframing harmful thoughts into alternatives that are more agentic and soluble. So, “That made me angry” becomes “I reacted to that by getting angry.” And “Life sucks” becomes “I feel like life sucks right now.” Where pathologization places problems outside your control, CBT places them within your control. Where pathologization bundles many small issues into one giant insurmountable problem, CBT breaks down giant problems into small manageable pieces.

- Digging for coal, day after day, for more than 50 years was excruciating work, but it was the spectre of injury and death that Mr Lee says was the hardest to bear. One day his hand got caught in a coal processing machine, but the loss of his fingers seemed minor, as he witnessed various friends be killed in a series of methane gas explosions. "We gave our entire youths to that coal mine, waiting for and fearing a meaningless death at any moment," he says. "I missed home so much, especially my family. Even animals, when they are nearing death, go back to their caves.”
- The North, after releasing just 8,000 prisoners, has refused to acknowledge that any more exist. Three days after his only son was killed in a mine accident, with his wife long dead, Mr Lee embarked on his journey. Now aged 77, he secretly waded across the river into China, the water up to his neck. He is one of 80 prisoners to have escaped and made it home to South Korea, with only 13 of the escapees still alive. The remaining tens of thousands of prisoners were left to perish in the mines. Few, if any, are still alive - though their children remain.
- [In South Korea] The prisoners of war (POWs) who never made it home are marked as missing, assumed dead, and are not honoured as war heroes. "The children of the POWs in North Korea suffered from the pain of guilt by association, and yet here in South Korea we are not acknowledged. We want to be given the same respect that the families of other fallen veterans receive," she said.

- A crinkle crankle wall, also called a serpentine wall, is a wavy wall that may seem to sacrifice some efficiency for aesthetics. The curves add visual interest, but they use more material than a straight wall. Except they don’t! They use more bricks than a straight wall of the same thickness but they don’t have to be as thick.

## These moisture-sucking materials could transform air conditioning

[https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/26/1076731/materials-air-conditioning/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/26/1076731/materials-air-conditioning/)

- A stream of air passes through a channel and over a thin layer of desiccant, which pulls moisture out of the air. Next, the now-dry air goes through an evaporative cooling step, which lowers the temperature of the air (basically the same way sweat cools your skin). In the evaporative cooling step, the air is split into two streams. One runs past a thin layer of water, which absorbs energy and drops the air’s temperature. That cooler, humid air is used to cool a metal surface, which in turn sucks heat out of the other stream of still-dry air. The humid air gets funneled outside, and the cool, dry air is blown into the building. The company’s approach should be able to cut annual electricity use by a total of between 50% and 80% compared with a conventional air conditioning system, depending on the environment.
- A desiccant cooling system needs a section that can regenerate the desiccant, releasing the water into another stream of air that in turn is released outside. Blue Frontier instead uses a heat pump to regenerate its desiccant. The heat pump adds energy demand, but while the cooling system can run continuously during a hot summer day, the regeneration system can run in the evening or overnight, when there’s less stress on the grid and electricity prices are lower. Offsetting the regeneration will mean that Blue Frontier’s system could help reduce peak power demand by between 80% and 90%.

## What is the best clothing to keep you cool?

[https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230802-what-is-the-best-clothing-to-keep-you-cool](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230802-what-is-the-best-clothing-to-keep-you-cool)

- The Bedouin's secret is wearing loose-fitting black clothing, especially if it's windy. The loose black clothes heat up the space between the fabric and the skin, promoting an upward air current – like a chimney – and providing cooling relief. The amount of heat gained by a Bedouin exposed to the hot desert is the same whether he wears a black or a white robe.
- If you are going to be wearing tight-fitting clothing, then stick with white.
- Fabrics with texture – such as seersucker or pique, a fabric often used in sports polo shirts – also help to lift clothing off your skin, rather than staying snug and tight-fitting.
- In dry heat, wicking alone may be enough because the sweat will be absorbed from your body and evaporate in the heat. When it's humid and hot, the air around you is already saturated with water vapour, meaning the sweat your clothes just soaked up doesn't have anywhere to go.
- Cotton and polyester absorb and reflect the majority of the infrared that hits them – nearly 99% – meaning they often appaer white in infrared images. But these materials also allow 30-40% of visible light through. This combination can cause the body to warm up faster than it otherwise would.
- Cotton absorbs moisture but it doesn't dry quickly. Linen has excellent breathability, but like cotton it is slow to dry.
- Merino wool is breathable and wicks moisture without retaining odour.
- Nylon and polyester wick moisture and dry quickly – but they retain odour. Nylon has a higher moisture absorption and better wicking capabilities than polyester, but is slower to dry.
- Bamboo, which is a low conductor of heat, and doesn't compromise on comfort.
- The key is a material that's opaque to visible light – reflects and doesn't absorb sunlight – but transparent in the infrared – allowing heat to leave the body rather than trapping between the material and the skin
- Perhaps, the best way to stay cool in the heat when it comes to clothing is actually just wearing wet clothes. Water needs heat energy to evaporate, and as it makes this transition from a liquid to a gas, it uses the heat coming from your body, cooling your skin and lowering your body temperature.

## The Plan to Build an Island Using Only Electricity

## Greenhushing, explained: Why companies have stopped talking about their climate pledges

[https://grist.org/language/greenhushing-climate-pledges-greenwashing-lawsuits/](https://grist.org/language/greenhushing-climate-pledges-greenwashing-lawsuits/)

- Nearly a quarter of large companies from around the globe have decided not to publicize their milestones on climate action, according to a report from South Pole last fall.
- Keeping quiet makes it hard to scrutinize what companies are doing, and also makes it more difficult for them to learn from one another’s mistakes.
- Companies may be unsure about how to comply with this legislation and are afraid of being sued: they therefore give up talking about their targets altogether.

## Revealed: Fossil Fuel Giants Are Using British Influencers to go Viral

- DeSmog analysed examples of more than 100 influencers being paid to promote fossil fuel firms worldwide since 2017, from the US to Malaysia, in campaigns that have reached billions of people.
- Our analysis uncovered promotional material from two PR firms representing Shell, boasting of the success of their online advertising. One of the PR companies claimed that content fronted by UK inventor Colin Furze reached nearly a billion people, while another claimed that a campaign with explorer Robert Swan OBE made Shell’s audience “31 percent more likely to believe” that the oil company is “committed to cleaner fuels”.
- In 2022, a Harvard University paper found that a “green innovation” narrative was one of the key social media tactics deployed by fossil fuel companies. Analysing 2,325 social media posts from 22 major European polluters, the report found that 72 percent of posts from oil and gas firms tried to emphasise their spending on green technology. As the study also pointed out, however, these firms invested just 1.7 percent of their annual capital expenditures in low carbon technologies between 2010 and 2018.

## [The Jordan Harbinger Show] 871: Julian Walker | How Conspiracy Theories Make Society Sick

- Conspiracies are like religions - they can give disenfranchised, scared people purpose, reason, community, feelings of power and superiority, and rituals.
- Often the conspiracy targets those you already dislike, e.g. natural health advocates blame pharma companies, anarchists blame the government, luddites blame technology.
- Sometimes it's just profiteering - create a community and it's easier to sell. This is especially true when your other income stream has been shut down (e.g. COVID shutting down yoga studios).

## The 17 Secrets to a Successful Relationship

[https://youtu.be/ak4j5pVHDGg](https://youtu.be/ak4j5pVHDGg)

1. Pick someone you feel profoundly grateful ever decided to look your way. Start from a sense that you are the lucky one - and that they are superior (the truth is irrelevant).
2. Make sure you fancy them. Check out that you have compatible areas of perversion - and little interest being normal in bed.
3. Allow yourselves both to admit, from an early stage, that you are ‘mad’; heavily distorted by your pasts, unable to understand yourselves, prone to irrational assumptions - and unsteady in your assessments of reality.
4. Make apology the most regular of occurrences. Say sorry about everything all the time and reduce the price of an admission to almost zero.
5. Remove all pride from your character. You were an idiot then, you are an idiot now, you will be an idiot tomorrow. There’s no other option for a human being. Make jokes.
6. Regularly explore how you have disappointed one another. Let them sometimes hate you and you them. Don’t be frightened by anger moderately expressed. The enemy of love is stifled emotion, not maturely explored authenticity. Listen very carefully when they tell you how they feel.
7. Never describe them categorically as this or that (insulting trait). Only ever say: I feel you are this or that… Observe the difference.
8. Get good at sensing the fear beneath your angry moods, then express the fear gently rather than acting out the anger.
9. Reduce expectations of perfection. It’s going to get horrible at times. Allow for major frustrations. You will want to kill them and they you. Don’t.
10. Accept you will have crushes on others. Let them wash over you - and, if the mood is right, share them with the partner.
11. If there are children, recognise that love will suffer hugely. Look forward to properly picking up the baton again in 15 years.
12. Become the sort of person who has no embarrassment about being ‘needy.’ Accept the child in you and look after their needs in the relationship.
13. Read up about attachment theory - and keep the concepts close at hand.
14. Stop being defensive; stop needing to maintain a proud hold on your own dignity. Laugh continually at your foolishness - and apologise for it.
15. Accept that they can’t save you from your own disturbances. Try to be happy in yourself and if you are not, don’t redirect the blame. Observe how often your rocky patches are projected versions of your own life crises. Get a therapist.
16. Don’t expect everything from love.
17. Be very prepared (though reluctant) to leave. Remain out of choice, never desperation.

- A sponge-like material developed at the University of Sydney holds on to CO2 molecules as air passes through it. Fans draw air into canisters containing the sponges, and then heat is used to extract the pure CO2 that can be pumped and stored underground. All power comes from the solar panels that cover the units like an A-frame tent.

- The Black Death caused capitalism by reducing labour supply and increasing land supply, therefore increasing peasant power versus the nobility.
- Smallpox (and others) conquered Latin America, not the Spanish. Given how deadly the diseases was, the natives believed it was due to the enemy’s god, which is why Christianity is so pervasive to this day in LatAm.

## Musk's Razor Explained: "The most entertaining outcome is the most likely.”

[https://blockbuster.thoughtleader.school/p/musks-razor-explained-the-most-entertaining](https://blockbuster.thoughtleader.school/p/musks-razor-explained-the-most-entertaining)

- Social institutions start out more or less as games that only later become serious and even deadly. Science began as a series of riddling contests, religion as joyful collective celebrations, military institutions as ceremonial combat, economic systems as festive reciprocal exchanges. Originally, Huizinga believes, people came together to have a good time, and only later developed rules to make the game more lasting and interesting. Eventually the rules became binding, and people were forced to obey them.

## How to sabotage your salary negotiations efforts before you even start

[https://interviewing.io/blog/sabotage-salary-negotiation-before-even-start](https://interviewing.io/blog/sabotage-salary-negotiation-before-even-start)

- Third party recruiters are incentivized to get the deal done, not to risk the deal by negotiating hard for you.
- [Internal recruiters are] incentivized, first and foremost, to follow the rules their head of department sets for them. This is true for how they evaluate candidates, who they let through, and how they read resumes. And it’s definitely true for how they negotiate.
- Specifically, do not share with recruiters anything about your salary history, your salary expectations, where else you’re interviewing, and how far along in the process you are with other companies. In short, don’t share any information about money or other interviews. Do not say a number first — ever.
- One exception to revealing information is this: Sometimes it can be useful to give your recruiter a rough estimate for when you’ll be collecting offers, e.g., “I’ve just started interviewing. I expect to get through all my interviews and onsites in the next 6 weeks and start collecting offers 2 months from now. Does that timeline work for you?”
- If the recruiter is making an offer, do not react to what you’re being told beyond expressing enthusiasm. Say that you need some time to process and/or talk to your {family, partner, spouse}.
- For questions about comp expectations at the beginning of the process: At this point, I don’t feel equipped to throw out a number because I’d like to find out more about the opportunity first – right now, I simply don’t have the data to be able to say something concrete. If you end up making me an offer, I would be more than happy to iterate on it if needed and figure out something that works. I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.
- For questions about comp expectations at the end of the process: It sounds like there’s an offer coming, and I’m really excited about it. I’m not sure exactly what number I’m looking for, but if you’d be able to share what an offer package might look like, then I will gladly iterate on it with you if needed and figure out something that works. I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.
- For questions about where else you’re interviewing at the beginning of the process: I’m currently speaking with a few other companies and am at various stages with them. I’ll let you know if I get to the point where I have an exploding offer, and I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.
- For questions about where else you’re interviewing at the end of the process: I’m wrapping things up with a few companies and in process with a few more. I promise to keep you in the loop, and I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.

## How London's West End Streets Got Their Names

[https://londonist.substack.com/p/how-londons-west-end-streets-got](https://londonist.substack.com/p/how-londons-west-end-streets-got)

- St Martin-in-the-Fields: St Martin’s is London’s most central church, mere metres from the official centre of Charing Cross. Yet it was not always thus. Braun and Hogenberg’s map of London shows the church to be on the very edge of the then-village of Charing, with open fields immediately north, where today you’d find the London Coliseum, the Chandos, and, um, Pret.
- Tottenham Court Road: Curiously, the names of Tottenham in north London and Tottenham Court Road are not thought to be related.

## SA's liver-born baby is a 'medical miracle’

- Usually, the egg is fertilised in the Fallopian tube and then moves down into the uterus. But sometimes the fertilised egg travels the wrong way, falls out of the fallopian tube and disappears.
- In Nhlahla's case, the fertilised egg had nestled on the surface of the liver, a rich source of blood, then grew into the liver, complete with placenta, amniotic sac and amniotic fluid to keep the baby safe.

## Why You Are Probably An NPC

[https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/why-you-are-probably-an-npc](https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/why-you-are-probably-an-npc)

1. The Conformist → but common wisdom can be wrong, and experts can have vested interests
2. The Contrarian → mindset: the mainstream is wrong, therefore the anti-mainstream must be right
3. The Disciple → a Contrarian, overwhelmed by the quantity of fringe theories, follows a leader, to reduce cognitive load
4. The Tribalist → believe everything on their side, disbelieve and blame the other side
5. The Averager → hedging beliefs and intelligence-signalling
- The solution is to divide issues into tertiary, secondary, and primary.
    - Tertiary issues are those you don’t need to care about: the overwhelming majority of things.
    - Secondary issues are things that interest you, but which you don’t need to get exactly right.
    - Primary issues are the ones you care about most, the ones you’re determined to get right.

## China’s blueprint for an alternative world order

- In the case of Cambodia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe — all of which owe hefty debts to China — their voting alignment with China in the assembly registered at 80 per cent or above, according to the research. “On average, a 10 per cent increase in voting alignment with China in the UN General Assembly yields a 276 per cent increase in aid and credit from Beijing,”
- In October last year, the UN Human Rights Council voted down a western-led motion to hold a debate on China’s human rights abuses after a cohort of developing countries backed Beijing. The council has 47 members, of whom 19 voted against the motion, 17 for and 11 abstained. It was only the second time in the council’s 16-year history that a motion had been rejected. It came just weeks after a finding by the UN Office of the High Commission for Human Rights that “serious human rights violations” had been committed by Beijing against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, a region in north-west China. Following that victory, China then enlisted 66 countries — most of them recipients of Chinese lending under the BRI — to support a statement at the UN praising its human rights record. Its signatories outnumbered the 50 mostly western countries that endorsed a rival statement which condemned China.

## 3D-Printed “Living Material” Could Clean Up Contaminated Water

- Dubbed an “engineered living material,” it is a 3D-printed structure made of a seaweed-based polymer combined with bacteria that have been genetically engineered to produce an enzyme that transforms various organic pollutants into benign molecules. The bacteria were also engineered to self-destruct in the presence of a molecule called theophylline, which is often found in tea and chocolate. This offers a way to eliminate them after they have done their job.

## Why the electric vehicle battery race needs a recycling revolution

- One model is to have the battery manufacturer, carmaker or a third party own the battery throughout its life. A battery manufacturer could lease the battery to a carmaker, then a consumer, and then reuse or recycle it after it can no longer power a vehicle.
- A battery no longer suitable for use in a vehicle still has the potential to be used for other purposes, ranging from lighting streets and homes to powering appliances or offering energy storage.

## Why the UK’s tax system is broken

[https://youtu.be/hjpXjV5WHjQ](https://youtu.be/hjpXjV5WHjQ)

- The UK's tax system is broken due to its lack of progressivity, neutrality, and effectiveness. It focuses on income rather than wealth, resulting in poorer people paying more taxes. Wealth taxes are not implemented effectively, and the council tax is not truly progressive. The system discourages productive work and encourages non-productive wealth accumulation. The income tax system is complicated, with numerous exemptions and complications. The value-added tax (VAT) regime is overly complex. Overall, the UK's tax system fails to address wealth inequality and is not conducive to economic growth. A potential for change lies with an incoming Labour government.

- Roughly half of this pollution comes from burning fossil fuels to heat an oven, known as a kiln, to extremely high temperatures. The other half is generated by a chemical reaction that occurs within the limestone, a core ingredient in traditional cement, inside this hot kiln. Sublime's technology eliminates both of these sources of pollution. The company employs a specialized electrical process capable of creating cement from certain types of rocks and industrial waste without releasing any harmful emissions or requiring the use of fossil fuels.

## How Medellin is beating the heat with green corridors

- The idea was to connect green spaces in the city together through avenues and streets surrounded by trees and shade.
- Initially the project involved planting some 120,000 individual plants and 12,500 trees on roads and in parks, with 2.5 million new smaller plants and 880,000 trees planted across the city by 2021.
- The initial investment to establish the project cost a total of $16.3m (£13.2m) and annual maintenance cost $625,000 (£504,000) in 2022, according to the local government.
- A 2021 study co-authored by Correa identified Mangifera indica as the best among six plant species found in Medellin at both absorbing PM2.5 and surviving in polluted regions, due to its "biochemical and biological mechanisms".
- No overall study or review has looked at how much the green corridors project has reduced air pollution yet.
- "The reduction in temperature, in some zones by more than 3C (5.4F), was bigger than we were expecting,"
- "We also saw the return of animals that had not been seen here for many years.”

## Noise-canceling robots to 'mute' loud conversations in cafe

[https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/noise-canceling-robots-to-mute-loud-conversations-in-cafe](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/noise-canceling-robots-to-mute-loud-conversations-in-cafe)

- The seven robotic microphones, each about an inch in diameter, will be linked to a central charging station. The robots can autonomously place themselves at various tables.
- If I have one microphone a foot away from me and another two feet away, my voice will arrive at the microphone that’s a foot away first. If someone else is closer to the microphone that’s two feet away, their voice will arrive there first. We developed neural networks that use these time-delayed signals to separate what each person is saying and track their positions in a space. So you can have four people having two conversations and isolate any of the four voices and locate each of the voices in a room.
- [The] microphones strategically placed near loud individuals can emit sound waves with an opposite phase (referred to as "anti-noise") to effectively neutralize or cancel out the noise.

## How Did Gogoro Go From Stealth Startup To Global Battery-Swapping Leader in Just Over A Decade?

[https://cleantechnica.com/2023/09/29/how-did-gogoro-go-from-stealth-startup-to-global-battery-swapping-leader-in-just-over-a-decade/](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/09/29/how-did-gogoro-go-from-stealth-startup-to-global-battery-swapping-leader-in-just-over-a-decade/)

- One factor that no doubt played a role in shaping Gogoro’s approach to strategy is the fact that the company’s CEO, Horace Luke, spent a formative decade of his career as a creative director at Microsoft. Helping to launch new products including Xbox and Windows XP, he learned how to build an ecosystem of manufacturers, distributors, and retailers centered around a shared platform, rather than a proprietary product.
- First, Gogoro developed a standard specification for swappable batteries that could be used in its own vehicles and in those produced by other manufacturers.
- Second, Gogoro implemented new business models aligned to the systems transformation it aimed to deliver. One of these was a customer-facing battery-as-a-service business model for vehicle owners that provides convenient access to Gogoro’s network of battery-swapping stations. A second was the GoShare model, offering instant access to shareable electric two-wheelers.
- The third component of Gogoro’s approach is its physical battery-swapping platform, which uses big data, AI, and machine learning to connect an entire ecosystem of smart vehicles, energy, and services for its users.

- A report from the Pew Charitable Trust found that 78 percent of ocean microplastics are from synthetic tire rubber.
- Emissions Analytics found that a single car's four tires collectively release 1 trillion "ultrafine" particles for every single kilometer (0.6 miles) driven. These particles, under 100 nanometers in size, are so tiny that they can pass directly through the lungs and into the blood. They can even cross the body's blood-brain barrier.

    - What do you love about?
    - It seems like you're having a tough time today (label emotions)
- Repeat last words instead of "I don't understand" or "what do you mean?" or "tell me more".

## 3MM: Body Positivity, Birth Control & Beliefs - Chris Williamson

- TLDR: Female support for body positivity is at least in-part fuelled deep down by female intrasexual competition, which pushes other women out of the dating pool by discouraging them from losing weight.
- A recent study published in Personality and Individual Differences found that women who are high in intrasexual competitiveness are more likely to advise women who they perceive as a potential mating threat to cut off more hair, potentially in an attempt to sabotage their attractiveness.

## Liebreich: ‘Oil sector is lobbying for inefficient hydrogen cars because it wants to delay electrification’

[https://www.rechargenews.com/energy-transition/liebreich-oil-sector-is-lobbying-for-inefficient-hydrogen-cars-because-it-wants-to-delay-electrification-/2-1-1033226](https://www.rechargenews.com/energy-transition/liebreich-oil-sector-is-lobbying-for-inefficient-hydrogen-cars-because-it-wants-to-delay-electrification-/2-1-1033226)

- “If you're an oil and gas company, in a way, talking about hydrogen is kind of a two-way bet because if it works, then you're embedded in the hydrogen industry — but if it doesn't work, you've delayed the transition to the thing you don't make, which is electricity,”
- Liebreich gives an example of Shell being happy to spend $12bn on a floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) platform, the Prelude, which has seen a host of problems, “but they won't spend $12bn just producing blue, green, pink, or any other sort of clean hydrogen for those [existing] uses where we currently are driving 3-4% of global emissions”.
- “Okay, so you've saved 45 minutes [refilling a hydrogen car at a fuelling station vs recharging an electric car]. The rest of the year, you're back at home and back to your boring commute, and you're driving your 20 miles a day. Well, every time you do 300 miles, you have to go to a hydrogen filling station [unlike a BEV that you can charge at home]. So 40 times a year, you have to waste 10 minutes and maybe more driving to a hydrogen filling station. That's 400 minutes and you've saved yourself 45 minutes on the, maybe, two to five times that you actually drive to your cottage or to the Alps, or wherever. So even on the time spent, on an annual basis, it's not a win, it's a big loss for most people.”

- Many microorganisms, fungi, algae, and corals protect themselves from the sun using highly effective molecules called mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs). Commercial sunscreens featuring MAAs are already in market, like MiBelle’s Helioguard 365.

## A brave seabird’s 11 hour, 712-mile-long journey through a typhoon

[https://interestingengineering.com/science/a-brave-seabirds-11-hour-712-mile-long-journey-through-a-typhoon](https://interestingengineering.com/science/a-brave-seabirds-11-hour-712-mile-long-journey-through-a-typhoon)

- The bird usually flies at a speed of 6.2- 37 mph (10-60 kph), but around the typhoon, the movement speed captured by the GPS was between 55-105 mph (90 to 170 kph). This probably means that the bird’s speed was affected as it may have been caught in the eye of the storm.
- The bird was found to be soaring at an altitude of 2.9 miles (4,700 meters) versus its usual altitude between 0.3 and 1.8 miles (600 and 3,000 meters).
- The bird returned to the sea around the same time as the typhoon, covering a circle of 712 miles (1,146 km) over 11 hours.

[https://www.nironmagnetics.com/](https://www.nironmagnetics.com/)

- Demand for the rare-earth magnets that help power EVs and wind turbines is skyrocketing. But rare-earth mining decimates ecosystems. Minnesota-based Niron Magnetics’ Clean Earth Magnet is made from iron and nitrogen, both abundant and affordable materials, eliminating the need for rare-earth mining. Niron’s magnets are also stronger than their rare-earth counterparts.

## A Primer on Circadian Rhythms

[https://biolayne.com/articles/research/primer-circadian-rhythms/](https://biolayne.com/articles/research/primer-circadian-rhythms/)

1. Sleep 7-9-hours a night.
2. Light
    1. Mornings: Aim to get 30mins outdoor natural light exposure. If you live in a region of the world with dark winter mornings, use a blue-light box or sunrise lamp for 15-30mins within an hour of waking
    2. Evenings: The key is minimizing light intensity and blue-light exposure. The lowest hanging fruit is as follows:
        1. Use soft side lighting and keep rooms lowly lit.
        2. Use F.lux on your laptop.
        3. Make your bedroom a tech-free zone, and keep it blacked out during sleep.
        4. Turn off intense blue-lighting – like TV’s – around an hour before bed.
        5. Wear blue-light blocking glasses.
3. Food
    1. Be consistent with regular meal timing: don’t have erratic eating patterns.
    2. Breakfast (high fat low carb) like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper for fat loss. Consume your largest daily calorie meal earlier in the day, i.e. before 3pm.
    3. Provide your body with distinct feed/fast cycles (TRF/IF) that align with your daily wake/sleep and active/inactive cycles.

## [My First Million] My $0 to $1 Million Guide - How I Would Start Over in 2024

1. Learn (10 years)
    1. Prioritise learning and networking over money
    2. Change jobs/careers every ~18 months to maximise learning
    3. Find your edge
        1. Shared: young and eager, small and helpless; lots of free time; nothing to lose
        2. Personal: unique combination (2-3) of skills/interests - find, or decide and create
    4. Surround yourself with similar people (motivation, dreams)
        1. Share learnings and support
        2. You can see others not much different from you succeeding
        3. Can be a start-up or a company
        4. Often involves physically moving cities
    5. Work on the A+ problem
        1. Whatever role you’re in, investigate to find the real A+ problem (or a way to make a big difference), come up with potential solutions, then pitch management (even CEO) to work on it full time (also good for networking/becoming known)
    6. Create luck
        1. Do more - create (good) content (which forces you to think and learn) and share it
    7. Start a service agency company
        1. Aim for 10 customers paying £10k/mo (B2B) (or 25x4 → £100k) → take a cut of their new profits
        2. Look on Upwork/Fiverr etc for existing ones that you could do myself or you could cheaply hire people to do e.g. web dev, marketing
2. Earn
    1. Invest in yourself, not stocks etc
        1. Buy back time (e.g. housekeeper, chef)
        2. Knowledge (books, groups, members clubs)
        3. Leave money on table (e.g. say no to bad clients)
3. Legacy
- Earn money and develop skills before trying to make impact

- In 2022 Baringa had 114 partners, sharing profit of £185m. That’s an average of £1.6m per partner.
- Like clockwork, this consulting business generates around 40% operating margins, every year. Profit per employee is steady, between £85k and £109k per year.
- This isn’t one business: it’s a federation. A franchise model. Each partner is running their own small business, under the Baringa brand.
- Each time, they’ve followed the same playbook: find who has built their expertise, relationships and reputation at another firm, and wants to do something entrepreneurial — and poach them.
- Baringa built their climate change model to help them better serve clients. Over time, that model became a significant asset in itself — so much so they could sell it, to the tune of $100m.

## Marches show UK multiculturalism has failed

- Nonetheless, the melting pot model that evolved in the northern states and then on the West Coast became, by the mid-20th century, the dominant ethos. Irish-Americans could keep their identity. So too Italian-Americans. Jewish-Americans could retain their traditions. As long as their allegiance was to America, its flag, and institutions. Disagree about everything else, but respect the elementary building blocks of nationhood.
- Few occasions are sacred to the British but Remembrance weekend comes close. So when several hundred thousand Britons decide that the time we set aside for respecting our war dead is a good time to descend on the capital with genocidal chants, it is clear Britain has lost its way.
- “The saddest thing my generation of veterans ever say to me is that they struggle to recognise the country they wore the uniform for. This is not it. We mustn’t allow it to become like this.”
- Decades of immersion in the relativist mantras of multiculturalism (prioritise group differences over integration — and don’t dare offend anyone) and an insistence on the inviolable right to protest mean that the poor police officers on the ground are being left, by their confused bosses and terrified politicians, to deal with agitators who hate this country.

- The research finds screen time leads to changes in the pre-frontal cortex of the brain, which is the base of executive functions such as working memory and the ability to plan or to respond flexibly to situations. It also finds impacts on the parietal lobe, which helps us to process touch, pressure, heat, cold, and pain; the temporal lobe, which is important for memory, hearing and language; and the occipital lobe, which helps us to interpret visual information.
- This was deemed as both potentially positive and negative, but mainly more negative.

## The boardroom drama behind Gymshark, one of the UK's fastest-growing companies

[https://www.netincome.co/p/the-boardroom-drama-behind-one-of](https://www.netincome.co/p/the-boardroom-drama-behind-one-of)

[https://www.netincome.co/p/gymshark-part-2-co-founder-exits](https://www.netincome.co/p/gymshark-part-2-co-founder-exits)

- [In 2012] Gymshark started with a very simple structure: Ben and Lewis each owned one share. || For four days, between 17th and 21st September 2016, Lewis Morgan appeared to have no stake in Gymshark at all. Or at the very least, it looks like Ben Francis, Steve Hewitt and Paul Richardson were forming a separate holding company without him. || Maybe they used this restructure to somehow threaten Lewis to force him to sell his shares to them at a deep discount?
- Now, [Ben] even gets to do fun rich people stuff, like take £10m of his own money that’s been distributed out of Gymshark to his family office co, and lend it back to them at a 3% premium to the SONIA rate, which means he’s making the best part of £1m a year just in interest! Isn’t being rich fun?
- The pair then meet experienced businessmen Paul Richardson and Steve Hewitt, who tell them words to the effect of: “What the fuck are you doing? Gymshark's the golden goose, just don't get distracted or fuck it up and you’ll both be rich — and we can help you.” And maybe Ben takes that message to heart — and Lewis doesn’t. Ben goes all-in on Gymshark, wholeheartedly, and swears to spend the next decade building an amazing company. Lewis wants to keep building other businesses too, and investing in property, and generally being a big swinging dick.
- Ben Francis has excellent tax advisors. Francis Family Office Ltd isn’t a mere holding company, it’s a family investment company. Assuming Francis survives for seven years after donating those shares, they become exempt from inheritance tax. To top it off, [he bought] a farm in the Cotswolds for his family. Buying a farm means you benefit from Agricultural Property Relief. Which again, means that when Francis dies and passes on the family farm to his kids, they won’t pay inheritance tax.
- Its cash conversion cycle is getting longer and longer. If they’re not funding their growth through a negative cash conversion cycle, and they only recently took outside money, how did they fund their growth? Debt. Sales are slowing, inventory is accumulating, and Gymshark is having to discount to get rid of that inventory, possibly in order to meet debt covenants or solve cash flow issues. Revenue hasn’t grown at all this financial year.

## Why scientists are making transparent wood

[https://knowablemagazine.org/article/technology/2023/why-scientists-are-making-transparent-wood](https://knowablemagazine.org/article/technology/2023/why-scientists-are-making-transparent-wood)

- Transparent wood could soon find uses in super-strong screens for smartphones; in soft, glowing light fixtures; and even as structural features, such as color-changing windows.
- The slim profile and strength of the material means it could be a great alternative to products made from thin, easily shattered cuts of plastic or glass, such as display screens.
- By incorporating polyethylene glycol, the scientists found that their wood could store heat when it was warm and release heat as it cooled.
- Since thicker wood is strong, it could be a partially load-bearing light source, potentially acting as a ceiling that provides soft, ambient light to a room.
- Transparent wood is a far better insulator than glass, so it could help buildings retain heat or keep it out.

- An international team of scientists led by Joanna Moncrieff of University College London screened 361 papers from six areas of research and carefully evaluated 17 of them. They found no convincing evidence that lower levels of serotonin caused or were even associated with depression. People with depression didn’t reliably seem to have less serotonin activity than people without the disorder. Experiments in which researchers artificially lowered the serotonin levels of volunteers didn’t consistently cause depression. Genetic studies also seemed to rule out any connection between genes affecting serotonin levels and depression, even when the researchers tried to consider stress as a possible cofactor.

## How some people get away with doing nothing at work

- “I feel like I’m falling behind,” he says. “I definitely want to move to a different company, and I’m hopeful that when I do that, my work and my mindset will change.”
- “It’s like being on vacation all the time, with occasional scrambling to do a thing, then doing the thing for a couple of hours, then going back to the rest of my life,” he says. “Even though I feel guilty about it sometimes ... it’s not really my job to tell a multinational company how to run a business or manage their employees.”
- He’s not concerned someone will notice what he’s up to because he can just close his office door. Plus, he’s got a mouse jiggler. “What’s ironic is that I’m seen as the high performer on the team, and I’m also confused,” he says. “I think it’s because they’re also just making up stuff to do as well.”
- “If you go in and say, ‘Hey, I’m underutilized right now,’ you’re basically putting a target on your back,” Creely says. “It sounds good on paper — you get paid to do nothing — but especially if you’re not well-connected, eventually that’s going to come to an end.”
- “You get managers who are either so disengaged that they truly are oblivious to the situation, they’re so disconnected from the work that they don’t have any sense of what the person is or isn’t doing or results they should be getting that they’re not getting,” Green says, “or you get a manager who does have a general sense of it that is so passive and nonconfrontational that they can’t bring themselves to do anything about it.”

- “People don’t exactly want to pay more for all that stuff,” Harrington says. “So what has to happen if everything is more expensive and the customers still want to pay the same price, something has to be cut and that’s often going to be the quality of the garment.”
- “In the design of objects, they’re trying to reduce the amount of labor, and that changes what the object is,” Bird says. “That produces cheaper goods, but it doesn’t necessarily produce better goods.”
- Even if you do want to hop off the treadmill of constantly buying and keep what you already have, companies have made that harder too. Your goods probably have a shorter life span than they did years ago, and if you want to repair them — especially tech — you’ll come up against major barriers.

## How I rewired my brain in six weeks

- Over six weeks, Barnhofer modified a mindfulness research course for me to try out. For 30 minutes a day, either as one single session or two 15-minute sessions, I practiced a guided mindfulness meditation by listening to a recording. In addition, I had one weekly meditation session with Barnhofer, who guided me over Zoom. I didn't increase my normal levels of exercise, but I did to push myself to run faster.
- One half of my amygdala – an almond-shaped structure important for emotional processing – had reduced in volume on the right side. When we experience increased stress, the amygdala grows.
- The other change was to my cingulate cortex, part of the limbic system that is involved in our behavioural and emotional responses. It is also important for the default mode network, a region that becomes active when the mind wanders and ruminates. In my brain, it had slightly increased in size over the six weeks, indicating increased control of that area.

1. Don't ask your barber if you need a haircut.
2. "I can fix the $32 trillion US debt problem in 5 minutes. You pass a law that when there’s a deficit of more than 3% of GDP, all sitting members congress are ineligible for re-election” - Warren Buffett
3. 33% of British criminals were dying en route to Australia in the 1700s. Britain switched from paying sea captains for every passenger who walked on the ship to paying them for every passenger who walked off. Immediately, the survival rate shot up to 99%.
4. How to waste your time: Try to defy the laws of physics -- or try to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.
5. “Never attribute to conspiracy what is more easily explained by incentives and incompetence.” - Naval
6. During the 1980's, the government of Athens came up with an idea to limit pollution: Odd-numbered and even-numbered license plates. On dates with an odd number, the odd plates could drive. And vice versa. The rich people just bought another car -- with even worse emissions. The streets got more jammed and the pollution got worse.
7. “If you reward profits alone, it’s the dumbest thing you could do. Employees will quit advertising and start shrinking the business” - Buffett
8. If video games teach us one thing: If you want to motivate humans, frequent rewards are more addicting than one-off rewards.
9. In Hungary, every woman who gives birth to 4 children or more never has to pay income tax. Prediction for the next 2 decades: As populations decline, every government will be focused on child-bearing incentives.
10. “I think I've been in the top 5% of my age cohort all my life in understanding the power of incentives, and all my life I've underestimated it. And never a year passes but I get some surprise that pushes my limit a little farther." - Munger
11. If a person tells you why their thing is great (city, relationship, or job) - take it with a pinch of salt. If they tell you why it's terrible - take it like a handful of gold. If someone swims upstream against their identity and incentives, it probably holds some deep truth.
12. Skinner's Law: If procrastinating, 2 ways to solve it: Option 1 - Make the pain of inaction > Pain of action; Option 2 - Make the pleasure of action > Pleasure of inaction. The person with a gun to their head and crack cocaine at the finish line doesn't need motivation.

## A chemical signal in human female tears lowers aggression in males

[https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002442](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002442)

- Rodent tears contain social chemosignals with diverse effects, including blocking male aggression. Human tears also contain a chemosignal that lowers male testosterone, but its behavioral significance was unclear. Because reduced testosterone is associated with reduced aggression, we tested the hypothesis that human tears act like rodent tears to block male aggression. Using a standard behavioral paradigm, we found that sniffing emotional tears with no odor percept reduced human male aggression by 43.7%. To probe the peripheral brain substrates of this effect, we applied tears to 62 human olfactory receptors in vitro. We identified 4 receptors that responded in a dose-dependent manner to this stimulus. Finally, to probe the central brain substrates of this effect, we repeated the experiment concurrent with functional brain imaging. We found that sniffing tears increased functional connectivity between the neural substrates of olfaction and aggression, reducing overall levels of neural activity in the latter. Taken together, our results imply that like in rodents, a human tear–bound chemosignal lowers male aggression, a mechanism that likely relies on the structural and functional overlap in the brain substrates of olfaction and aggression. We suggest that tears are a mammalian-wide mechanism that provides a chemical blanket protecting against aggression.

## 11 Great Christopher Hitchens Quotes

- “I’ll try anything once except incest and folk dancing.”
- “To whom do you award the right to decide which speech is harmful or who is the harmful speaker? To whom would you delegate the task of deciding for you what you could read?”
- “I learned that very often the most intolerant and narrow-minded people are the ones who congratulate themselves on their tolerance and open-mindedness.”
- “Owners of dogs will have noticed that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they will think you are god. Whereas owners of cats are compelled to realise that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they draw the conclusion that they are gods.”
- “If someone tells me that I’ve hurt their feelings, I say, ‘I’m still waiting to hear what your point is.’
- I’m very depressed how in this country you can be told, ‘That’s offensive!’ as if those two words constitute an argument.”
- “Those who are determined to be ‘offended’ will discover a provocation somewhere. We cannot possibly adjust enough to please the fanatics, and it is degrading to make the attempt.”
- “I have one consistency, which is being against the totalitarian – on the left and on the right.
The totalitarian, to me, is the enemy; the one that’s absolute, the one that wants control over the inside of your head, not just your actions and your taxes.”
- “When you hear people demanding that the Ten Commandments be displayed in courtrooms and schoolrooms, always be sure to ask which set. It works every time.”
- “The four most overrated things in the world are champagne, lobster, anal sex and picnics.”
- “Everybody does have a book in them, but in most cases that's where it should stay.”
