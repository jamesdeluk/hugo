- To overcome this, the company is introducing new smaller, lightweight battery tech. Nybolt claims with the EV weighing “closer to one tonne than two,” the Lotus Elise-inspired electric car will have a range of up to 155 miles (250 km).

- “If all eligible urban flat roofs in the tropics and temperate regions were gradually converted to white (and sloped roofs to cool colors), they would offset the heating effect of the emission of roughly 24 gigatons of CO2, but one-time only,”

- The square-kilometre site may one day yield as much as 2,000 tonnes of seaweed per year. Algapelago’s target market is agriculture; one recent study found that feeding cows seaweed reduced their methane emissions by over 80%.

## How South Korea Puts Its Food Scraps to Good Use

[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/14/world/asia/south-korea-food-waste.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/14/world/asia/south-korea-food-waste.html)

- South Korea banned food scraps from its landfills almost 20 years ago. Here, the vast majority of it gets turned into animal feed, fertilizer and fuel for heating homes.
- Debris — bones, seeds, shells — is picked out by hand. (Dobong’s plant is one of the last in the nation where this step isn’t automated.) A conveyor belt carries the waste into a grinder, which reduces it to small pieces. Anything that isn’t easily shredded, like plastic bags, is filtered out and incinerated. Then the waste is baked and dehydrated. The moisture goes into pipes leading to a water treatment plant, where some of it is used to produce biogas. The rest is purified and discharged into a nearby stream. What’s left of the waste at the processing plant is ground into the final product: a dry, brown powder that smells like dirt. It’s a feed supplement for chickens and ducks, rich in protein and fiber, and given away to any farm that wants it.

## 40 Mind-Expanding Concepts (Summer 2023)

[https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/40-mind-expanding-concepts-summer](https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/40-mind-expanding-concepts-summer)

- If a talent comes naturally to someone, they assume it’s nothing special, and instead try to improve at what seems difficult to them. Therefore, people often specialize in things they're bad at.
- Kleck (1980) told his research subjects they’d engage in a study to test discrimination. He painted scars on some of their faces, and then had them attend job interviews. The participants with scars painted on their faces reported feeling discriminated against for their looks. However, unknown to them, their scars had been removed before they entered the interviews. It would seem we can be victimized by the mere belief that we’re a victim.
- How do "kind" falsehoods like "sex is a spectrum" and "obesity is healthy" go mainstream? Activists with PhDs use academic journals & scientific jargon to disguise ideology as knowledge, which is then cited as fact by the media & Wikipedia.

## [More or Less: Behind the Stats] Mortgages, birth rates and does space contribute 18% to UK GDP?

- Mortgage rates were higher in the 70s/80s, but on a lower amount (both earnings multiple and monetary value). If salary = £25,000: 12% of £50,000 (2x) = 6% of £100,000 (4x).
- South Korea birth rate = 0.78. 100 parents -> 39 children -> 15 grandchildren -> 6 great-grandchildren. Terrifyingly fast drop.
