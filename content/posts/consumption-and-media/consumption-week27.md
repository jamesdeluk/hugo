## [People Fixing the World] The power of a backstory

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0fym29n](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0fym29n)

- It makes sense from a business perspective too. A one-page biography improves patient care through humanisation, which both reduces costs and increases customer satisfaction. Win-win.
